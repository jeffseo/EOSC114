#Module: The Turbulent Atmosphere - Storms
**LEARNING GOALS:**
A. Be wary of the main storm hazards.
B. Recognize thunderstorms, be able to identify thunderstorm components, and and explain how they evolve.
C. Explain how storms get their energy from the Sun.
D. Explain the main characteristics that make a supercell thunderstorm so much nastier than a normal thunderstorm.
￼￼￼￼E. Be able to recognize thunderstorms in radar and satellite images.

F. Describe the different types of lightning, how they form, and what happens when they strike something.
G. Explain the behavior of downbursts and gust fronts, and identify their associated cloud & dust features.
H. Describe why the fact that "cold air holds less water vapour than warm air" is critical in explaining how thunderstorms can extract energy from humid air.
I. Recognize mammatus clouds and the flanking line, and describe their relationship to thunderstorms.
J. Explain how vertical and horizontal winds are created by heat released in storms.
K. Explain what the continuity effect is, and how it ties vertical and horizontal motions into circulations.
L. Describe rain and hail hazards of thunderstorms, and state actions you can take to be safe near thunderstorms.
M. Be able to recognize tornadoes and wall clouds.
N. Explain why supercell thunderstorms spawn the most dangerous tornadoes.
O. Relate the Enhanced Fujita scale to different amounts of damage.
P. Describe safety procedures near tornadoes.
Q. Identify the times and places for high tornado risk.
R. Identify the components of a hurricane.
S. Explain how hurricanes get and utilize heat energy, and why hurricanes can exist for weeks.
T. List the requirements for hurricane existence, describe how hurricanes evolve, and what causes them to die.
U. Describe the risks associated with hurricanes, and appropriate safety procedures.

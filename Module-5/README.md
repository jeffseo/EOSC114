#Module: The Turbulent Atmosphere - Storms
**LEARNING GOALS:**
  1. Be wary of the main storm hazards.
    1. Thunderstorms can create many hazards to life and property: lightning, tornadoes, hail, downpours and local flooding, and downburst and gustfronts (we will learn about these in later vignettes).
  2. Recognize thunderstorms, be able to identify thunderstorm components, and and explain how they evolve.
    1. Thunderstorms are **cumulonimbus** clouds that have **lightning** and **thunder**. These are deep clouds with strong **updrafts**, with a cloud base near the ground and cloud top near the top of the **troposphere** (roughly 11 km above sea level). Mature thunderstorms have a characteristic **anvil** or mushroom top, which can spread large distances (hundreds of km) downwind if blown by strong winds aloft.
    2. Normally, the anvil is at the top of the troposphere, at a location called the **tropopause.** 
    3. For thunderstorms with strong updrafts, the cloudy air can overshoot above the anvil into the lower stratosphere, causing an "**overshooting top**".

    5. Thunderstorms normally move from **southwest to northeast** in the Northern Hemisphere. Best place to view thunderstorms is southeast of the storm where you stay out of its path.
    6. The **mammatus clouds** are visible on the underside of anvil clouds sometimes but these give NO clue as to the intensity of the thunderstorm, or whether tornadoes are present. Note that not all thunderstorm anvils have mammatus clouds, and sometimes these clouds form on the underside of non-thunderstorm clouds.
    7. A thunderstorm cloud that you see with your eye often contains one or more **cells**. Each cell has a life cycle that lasts for 5 to 15 minutes. Refer to the figure above, where orange represents warm, humid boundary layer air, blue represents cold downburst air, grey represents clouds, and blue hatching indicates precipitation.
      1. Stage 1. It starts as a **cumulus phase**, having all updraft, no precipitation (i.e., rain, snow, sleet, hail, etc), and no anvil
      2. Stage 2. Next is the **mature stage**, having both up and downdrafts (both of which could be violent), having precipitation (which could be heavy) and the start of an anvil with a sharp or crisp outline
      3. Stage 3. Finally is the **dissipating stage**, with only downdrafts, weaker precipitation, and a large anvil with a diffuse outline.  However, even after the original (mother) storm has dissipated, the gust front that it earlier created might encounter some more warm boundary layer air before it dies.
      4. Stage 4. When this happens, the cold gust-front air plows under the warmer, humid boundary layer air, triggering an updraft that can spawn a new (daughter) thunderstorm. This process is called **storm propagation**.
    8. Thunderstorm organizations include:
      1. **Orographic Thunderstorms**: Sometimes these orographic storms stay anchored over the mountains for a long time, due to favorable wind shear that continually feeds the storm with more fuel from the boundary layer. These stationary storms can cause dangerous **flash floods** that rush down the mountain canyons, because of the large accumulation of precipitation that falls upstream within the watershed.
      2. **Multicell Storms**: A thunderstorm that contains many cells is called a multi-cell storm, and are the **most common** type of thunderstorm.  Often, the different cells are in different stages of their life cycle, with some older cells dissipating while newer cells are just forming. In some multi-cell storms, there is a flanking line of clouds sticking out from the main updraft (figure below on page 30). In this **flanking line** are often the new cells still in the cumulus stage. As they grow, the prevailing winds blow those cells into the main updraft, by which time the cells are often in the mature stage.
      3. **Squall Lines**: Sometimes thunderstorms form in lines called **squall lines** or **squall-line thunderstorms** (see figure below on page 31 for a radar image of a squall line moving across Pennsylvania), where the heaviest rain cells merge into a long narrow line.

Hence, it is a special type of multi-cell storm. These lines of storms can move toward the east or southeast, even though the individual thunderstorms within them are moving toward the northeast. Squall-line thunderstorms can be triggered along strong cold fronts or other strong air-mass boundaries.
      4. **Air Mass Thunderstorms**: are garden-variety storms that pop up in scattered locations within a large air mass due to strong heating of the ground by the sun (as circled in red in the figure below from the previous Lesson page 33). Hence, these don't need to form along fronts or boundaries. Also, such thunderstorms are often short lived.
      5. **Supercell Storms**: Some thunderstorms organize themselves into **supercell** storms, which are often severe, long lasting, often rotating, having violent wind gusts, and can cause tornadoes and hail.  These come in different flavors:
        1. Low precipitation (LP)
        2. classic
        3. high precipitation (HP)  
      
      Supercell thunderstorms are often the **most dangerous variety**, and often consist of just one rotating cell.  

      Supercells can last for 30 minutes and longer, due to favorable **wind shear** in the environment. Wind shear is when the wind speed or direction changes with altitude. In the case of supercell storms, there is often low altitude flow from the southeast, mid-altitude flow from the southwest, and fast upper-level flow is from the west. It is this mid-level wind (at roughly 5 km above ground) that steers thunderstorms toward the northeast, allowing the supercell storm to continuously draw in new humid boundary-layer air as fuel.  

      Often, the whole supercell thunderstorm is rotating. This rotation is called a **mesocyclone**, and is often visible to the eye by the barrel-shaped appearance of the outside of the storm. Sometimes, as a result of this rotation, there are cloud striations (like the grooves on a screw) that spiral around the main updraft clouds (see Figure ST.29 photo D on next page). Time-lapse photographs of supercell mesocyclones clearly show the rotation of the whole thunderstorm. Also, the mesocyclone rotation can be observed by **Doppler radar**, which can detect motions inside the storm. The images on the next page are good examples of rotating supercell thunderstorms (page 36).  
      
      It is from mesocyclone rotation that the strongest tornadoes are formed (see Lesson 5).
  3. Explain how storms get their energy from the Sun.
  4. Explain the main characteristics that make a supercell thunderstorm so much nastier than a normal thunderstorm.
  5. Be able to recognize thunderstorms in radar and satellite images.
    1. Weather radar transmits a beam of microwaves into the atmosphere, and "listens" for the faint echo of microwave energy that bounces back off of raindrops. Heavier rain causes a stronger echo, which is often coloured as yellow and red on radar displays. The lighter rain is shown with the blues and greens. The radar image below shows a number of thunderstorms producing spotty heavy rain, with no rain (shown as black in this image) in between.
    2. On visible satellite photos of thunderstorms, you can often see the shadow of the thunderstorm anvil that is cast on the lower clouds or on the ground. The anvils (marking the tops of thunderstorms) in the satellite image below are circled in red. (Shown on page 8)
  6. Describe the different types of lightning, how they form, and what happens when they strike something.
  7. Explain the behavior of downbursts and gust fronts, and identify their associated cloud & dust features.
  8. Describe why the fact that "cold air holds less water vapour than warm air" is critical in explaining how thunderstorms can extract energy from humid air.
    1. Warmer air can hold more water vapour at equilibrium than colder air. 
    2. Storms get their energy from temperature and humidity in the air. This energy is converted into violent winds and storm circulations through pressure and buoyancy. These circulations create organized storms that increase their own longevity by drawing in more heat and moisture. The results are spectacular and violent storms that behave in ways that can be understood for better safety and storm-chasing.
  9. Recognize mammatus clouds and the flanking line, and describe their relationship to thunderstorms.
  10. Explain how vertical and horizontal winds are created by heat released in storms.
  11. Explain what the continuity effect is, and how it ties vertical and horizontal motions into circulations.
  12. Describe rain and hail hazards of thunderstorms, and state actions you can take to be safe near thunderstorms.
  13. Be able to recognize tornadoes and wall clouds.
  14. Explain why supercell thunderstorms spawn the most dangerous tornadoes.
  15. Relate the Enhanced Fujita scale to different amounts of damage.
  16. Describe safety procedures near tornadoes.
  17. Identify the times and places for high tornado risk.
  18. Identify the components of a hurricane.
  19. Explain how hurricanes get and utilize heat energy, and why hurricanes can exist for weeks.
  20. List the requirements for hurricane existence, describe how hurricanes evolve, and what causes them to die.
  21. Describe the risks associated with hurricanes, and appropriate safety procedures.

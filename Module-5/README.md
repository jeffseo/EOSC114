#Module: The Turbulent Atmosphere - Storms
**LEARNING GOALS:**
  1. **Be wary of the main storm hazards.**
    1. Thunderstorms can create many hazards to life and property: lightning, tornadoes, hail, downpours and local flooding, and downburst and gustfronts (we will learn about these in later vignettes).
  2. **Recognize thunderstorms, be able to identify thunderstorm components, and and explain how they evolve.**
    1. Thunderstorms are **cumulonimbus** clouds that have **lightning** and **thunder**. These are deep clouds with strong **updrafts**, with a cloud base near the ground and cloud top near the top of the **troposphere** (roughly 11 km above sea level). Mature thunderstorms have a characteristic **anvil** or mushroom top, which can spread large distances (hundreds of km) downwind if blown by strong winds aloft.
    2. Normally, the anvil is at the top of the troposphere, at a location called the **tropopause.** 
    3. For thunderstorms with strong updrafts, the cloudy air can overshoot above the anvil into the lower stratosphere, causing an "**overshooting top**". 
    4. ![alt tag](http://www.eos.ubc.ca/courses/Dist-Ed/eosc114-Storms/Storms/STimages/tstorm-basics-stull.jpg)
    5. Thunderstorms normally move from **southwest to northeast** in the Northern Hemisphere. Best place to view thunderstorms is southeast of the storm where you stay out of its path.
    6. The **mammatus clouds** are visible on the underside of anvil clouds sometimes but these give NO clue as to the intensity of the thunderstorm, or whether tornadoes are present. Note that not all thunderstorm anvils have mammatus clouds, and sometimes these clouds form on the underside of non-thunderstorm clouds.
    7. A thunderstorm cloud that you see with your eye often contains one or more **cells**. Each cell has a life cycle that lasts for 5 to 15 minutes. Refer to the figure above, where orange represents warm, humid boundary layer air, blue represents cold downburst air, grey represents clouds, and blue hatching indicates precipitation.
      1. Stage 1. It starts as a **cumulus phase**, having all updraft, no precipitation (i.e., rain, snow, sleet, hail, etc), and no anvil
      2. Stage 2. Next is the **mature stage**, having both up and downdrafts (both of which could be violent), having precipitation (which could be heavy) and the start of an anvil with a sharp or crisp outline
      3. Stage 3. Finally is the **dissipating stage**, with only downdrafts, weaker precipitation, and a large anvil with a diffuse outline.  However, even after the original (mother) storm has dissipated, the gust front that it earlier created might encounter some more warm boundary layer air before it dies.
      4. Stage 4. When this happens, the cold gust-front air plows under the warmer, humid boundary layer air, triggering an updraft that can spawn a new (daughter) thunderstorm. This process is called **storm propagation**.
    8. Thunderstorm organizations include:
      1. **Orographic Thunderstorms**: Sometimes these orographic storms stay anchored over the mountains for a long time, due to favorable wind shear that continually feeds the storm with more fuel from the boundary layer. These stationary storms can cause dangerous **flash floods** that rush down the mountain canyons, because of the large accumulation of precipitation that falls upstream within the watershed.
      2. **Multicell Storms**: A thunderstorm that contains many cells is called a multi-cell storm, and are the **most common** type of thunderstorm.  Often, the different cells are in different stages of their life cycle, with some older cells dissipating while newer cells are just forming. In some multi-cell storms, there is a flanking line of clouds sticking out from the main updraft (figure below on page 30). In this **flanking line** are often the new cells still in the cumulus stage. As they grow, the prevailing winds blow those cells into the main updraft, by which time the cells are often in the mature stage.
      3. **Squall Lines**: Sometimes thunderstorms form in lines called **squall lines** or **squall-line thunderstorms** (see figure below on page 31 for a radar image of a squall line moving across Pennsylvania), where the heaviest rain cells merge into a long narrow line.
￼
Hence, it is a special type of multi-cell storm. These lines of storms can move toward the east or southeast, even though the individual thunderstorms within them are moving toward the northeast. Squall-line thunderstorms can be triggered along strong cold fronts or other strong air-mass boundaries.
      4. **Air Mass Thunderstorms**: are garden-variety storms that pop up in scattered locations within a large air mass due to strong heating of the ground by the sun (as circled in red in the figure below from the previous Lesson page 33). Hence, these don't need to form along fronts or boundaries. Also, such thunderstorms are often short lived.
      5. **Supercell Storms**: Some thunderstorms organize themselves into **supercell** storms, which are often severe, long lasting, often rotating, having violent wind gusts, and can cause tornadoes and hail.  These come in different flavors:
        1. Low precipitation (LP)
        2. classic
        3. high precipitation (HP)  
      
      Supercell thunderstorms are often the **most dangerous variety**, and often consist of just one rotating cell.  

      Supercells can last for 30 minutes and longer, due to favorable **wind shear** in the environment. Wind shear is when the wind speed or direction changes with altitude. In the case of supercell storms, there is often low altitude flow from the southeast, mid-altitude flow from the southwest, and fast upper-level flow is from the west. It is this mid-level wind (at roughly 5 km above ground) that steers thunderstorms toward the northeast, allowing the supercell storm to continuously draw in new humid boundary-layer air as fuel.  

      Often, the whole supercell thunderstorm is rotating. This rotation is called a **mesocyclone**, and is often visible to the eye by the barrel-shaped appearance of the outside of the storm. Sometimes, as a result of this rotation, there are cloud striations (like the grooves on a screw) that spiral around the main updraft clouds (see Figure ST.29 photo D on next page). Time-lapse photographs of supercell mesocyclones clearly show the rotation of the whole thunderstorm. Also, the mesocyclone rotation can be observed by **Doppler radar**, which can detect motions inside the storm. The images on the next page are good examples of rotating supercell thunderstorms (page 36).  
      
      It is from mesocyclone rotation that the strongest tornadoes are formed (see Lesson 5).
    9. **SUMMARY (of page 92):** Air cools at the dry adiabatic lapse rate as it rises. If lifted high enough to become cold enough to reach saturation, then condensation of water occurs within the air parcel. This marks cloud- base (LCL) altitude for cumuliform clouds such as thunderstorms and cumulus clouds.  
As the cloudy air parcel continues to rise, it still cools, but at a slower rate called the saturated or moist adiabatic lapse rate. Eventually the rising air parcel reaches the tropopause, where it stops rising and spreads out to form the characteristic anvil shape at the top of thunderstorms.  
Most thunderstorms are short-lived because of the limited availability of boundary-layer fuel nearby. But some severe storms such as supercells exist in an environment with wind shear, and can last longer.
  3. **Explain how storms get their energy from the Sun.**
    1. Page 45
    2. When the remaining sunlight *(that passed through Thermosphere [absorbs non-visible radiation], stratosphere [absorbes most of the ultraviolet light], and reaches the troposphere)* is absorbed by the ground, it causes Earth's surface to get warm. When this occurs, some of the energy can be consumed evaporating liquid water from the oceans, lakes, rivers, vegetation, and soil. This portion of energy from the sun is hidden as **latent heat** in the water vapour. The remainder goes into **sensible heating** of the air.
    3. Therefore, the portion of energy from the sun that is captured at the Earth's surface is split into two parts:
      1. Sensible heat
      2. Latent heat
    And these two heat sources are the fuel for storms which we measure by air temperature and humidity, respectively.
    **TEMPERATURE** and **HUMIDITY** are very important when studying storms.
    4. Since the sun is only available during the day, it is near sunset when the greater accumulation of heat occurs. Therefore, **late afternoon and early evening are the most likely times for thunderstorm formation**.
    5. Wind moves warm and humid air. Such movement of heat and humidity by the wind is called **advection**. When some of the water vapour in humid air condenses, latent heat is released and converted into sensible heat, thereby increasing the air temperature. The net result is that the Sun's energy can be drawn into storms by two mechanisms (figure below): **advection of heat** (temperature), and **advection of moisture** (humidity).
    6. **SUMMARY:** The Sun heats the Earth's surface, which warms the air and evaporates water. This warm humid air is the fuel for storms, and can be advected into the storm by winds. Once this fuel is in the storm, water vapour condenses and releases latent heat, which both provides energy for the storm and creates precipitation. Organized storms (with positive feedback) are stronger.
  4. **Explain the main characteristics that make a supercell thunderstorm so much nastier than a normal thunderstorm.**
  5. **Be able to recognize thunderstorms in radar and satellite images.**
    1. Weather radar transmits a beam of microwaves into the atmosphere, and "listens" for the faint echo of microwave energy that bounces back off of raindrops. Heavier rain causes a stronger echo, which is often coloured as yellow and red on radar displays. The lighter rain is shown with the blues and greens. The radar image below shows a number of thunderstorms producing spotty heavy rain, with no rain (shown as black in this image) in between.
    2. On visible satellite photos of thunderstorms, you can often see the shadow of the thunderstorm anvil that is cast on the lower clouds or on the ground. The anvils (marking the tops of thunderstorms) in the satellite image below are circled in red. (Shown on page 8)
  6. **Describe the different types of lightning, how they form, and what happens when they strike something.**
    1. Classification:
      1. **cloud-to-cloud (intercloud, IC)**
      2. **cloud-to-ground (CG)** - can be further classified whether **negative** or **positive** charges move to the ground. Negative strikes form from the cloud base and are more numerous. Positive strikes are less frequent and are often much stronger, and form from the thunderstorm anvil. 
    2. Diagram on page 55. Lightning forms because electrical charges build up in thunderstorms, associated with the freezing and collision of cloud droplets and ice crystals (called **graupeln**). When the electrical potential (i.e., charge difference) between the cloud and ground becomes great enough (a **breakdown potential** of 3 billion volts / km is needed, for every km length of the lightning bolt), the air **ionizes**.  
      
      This changes the air from an insulator to a conductor, along that ionized path. This path very rapidly steps down from the cloud, and is known as a **stepped leader**. When it nears the ground **streamers** of electrons rise from tall trees, poles, and buildings to meet the stepped leader. Once they make this connection, closing the circuit, the electrons flow in a massive current (2,000 to 200,000 amperes) called the **return stroke**.   
      
      It is this return stroke that you see, and which creates the thunder. This return stroke partially discharges the cloud. If you see a lightning bolt flicker, it is because there are many discharges (i.e., many return strokes) happening in short succession down the same ionized path, before the path is torn apart by the wind.
  7. **Explain the behavior of downbursts and gust fronts, and identify their associated cloud & dust features.**
    1. **Downbursts** are regions of rapidly descending air. From thunderstorms, downbursts are caused both by falling rain that drags some air down with it, and by the evaporation of some of the rain as it falls, which cools the air (cold air sinks). Downbursts can be a hazard to aircraft, especially just after takeoff or just before landing.
    2. **Gust Fronts**. When the downburst hits the ground, the air spreads out to create violent **straight-line winds** that can be a hazard to mobile homes. The leading edge of this cold, spreading air is called the **gust front**. If this gust front blows over dry dusty surfaces, it can pick up lots of dust to become a dust storm or sand storm called a **haboob**. In humid regions, the advancing gust front can push the surrounding warm, humid air upward to create a cloud called an arc cloud. The gust front and arc cloud initially form immediately around the precipitation area, but sometimes they advance faster than the thunderstorm moves and end up well in front of the precipitation areas.

  8. **Describe why the fact that "cold air holds less water vapour than warm air" is critical in explaining how thunderstorms can extract energy from humid air.**
    1. Warmer air can hold more water vapour at equilibrium than colder air. 
    2. Storms get their energy from temperature and humidity in the air. This energy is converted into violent winds and storm circulations through pressure and buoyancy. These circulations create organized storms that increase their own longevity by drawing in more heat and moisture. The results are spectacular and violent storms that behave in ways that can be understood for better safety and storm-chasing.
    3. **Sensible heat** is consumed to evaporate water (i.e., to change its phase from liquid to vapour). This sensible heat is absorbed from the air surrounding the water and is "hidden" in the water vapour. Once "hidden" it is called **latent heat**. As air gives its heat up, it becomes cooler; it also becomes more humid due to the increased amount of water vapour.  
    When water vapour condenses, the latent heat is converted back into sensible heat and returned to the surrounding air. This causes the air to get warmer. Namely, during condensation, the water gives back the heat into the air. Thus, humidity (the amount of water vapour in the air) also represents a measure of energy that can be released to power storms.
    4. The sneaky aspect of this process is that sensible heat can be consumed to evaporate water in one location, but the water vapour can be blown by the wind to a different location such as a storm. When it condenses in this new location, it heats the storm. This is one of the major ways that storms get their energy -- through water vapour that is drawn into the storm and then condenses to release its latent heat. Thus, movement of water vapour causes movement of energy (heat).
    5. to calculate the amount of latent heat Q, Q = m * L where m is the mass of water that is affected and L is the latent heat value.
    6. Thus, thunderstorms are most likely to form in regions where there is the greatest supply of heat and moisture; namely, closer to the equator near warm ocean currents.
  9. **Recognize mammatus clouds and the flanking line, and describe their relationship to thunderstorms.**
  10. **Explain how vertical and horizontal winds are created by heat released in storms.**
    1. Warmer temperatures can cause motions (winds) in storms via buoyancy and pressure. **Buoyancy** creates **vertical motions** (up and downdrafts) and is the dominant process in thunderstorms. **Pressure** creates **horizontal motions** (horizontal winds), and is the dominant process in **cyclones**. Both buoyancy and pressure are important in **hurricanes**.  
    Not only do storm winds cause damage directly, but also the winds are responsible for advecting into the storm more of the warm, humid air that is their fuel. Thus, without processes to convert temperature into motion, storms would probably not exist as we know them, because they wouldn't be able to continue to draw in fuel to survive for long times. Storms are said to be **organized** if they tend perpetuate themselves with this positive feedback.
    2. Forces create wind by moving air parcels and when air parcel moves, this is nothing more than wind.
    3. **Temperature Alters Buoyancy to Drive Vertical Winds** - Warm air wants to rise, thereby creating updrafts. Cold air wants to sink, thereby creating downdrafts. The reason for these vertical motions is that temperature affects the density of air, and density affects buoyancy. **Warm air is less dense than cold air**.
    4. **Temperature Alters Pressure to Drive Horizontal Winds** - Warm air is less dense than cold air. Thus, the warm column of air takes up more vertical space than the cold column, even if they contain the same number of molecules. This effect causes atmospheric pressure to decrease with height more gradually in warm air than in cold.  A **horizontal pressure gradient** occurs when the pressure at the top of the core of the hurricane expands due to warm air thus causing it to be greater than surrounding pressures of the same altitude. This ultimately creates wind to spiraling outwards to remove air molecules from the core to reduce the pressure.  
    Fewer molecules in the core causes lower pressure at the surface (as shown in the figure below), because pressure is the weight of all the overlying air. This low pressure at the bottom of the core creates a pressure gradient that sucks in air. This gives the spiral inflow into the bottom of a hurricane. **This inflow advects in more fuel (warm humid air), making the hurricane stronger.**
  11. **Explain what the continuity effect is, and how it ties vertical and horizontal motions into circulations.**
    1. Vertical and horizontal motions (winds) are tied together by the concept of **continuity**. By "continuity", we mean that the air molecules tend to spread themselves smoothly and evenly, and don't leave any gaps (i.e., they don't leave a vacuum), and don't get bunched together. Namely, the air is continuous. (on page 72)    
    2. To see how this works, picture a buoyant air parcel that is rising from near the surface (Figure ST.60a). Initially, the air molecules are smoothly and evenly distributed both in the air parcel, and in the environmental air that surrounds the air parcel.  
    3. However, as the air parcel rises it leaves a hole where it used to be (Figure ST.60b). This hole is a (partial) vacuum; namely, it has lower pressure than the surrounding air. Hence the surrounding air is sucked into it to try to eliminate the hole (Figure ST.60c). The net result is that the vertical motion generated initially by buoyancy within the parcel will generate a horizontal motion in the air just outside and under the parcel.  
    4. Similarly, as the air parcel rises, air molecules ahead (above) it get bunched together. This tends to increase the pressure, which pushes the extra air molecules horizontally out of the way (Figure ST.60d). In turn, the horizontally moving air creates gaps or bunched-up air molecules slightly off to the sides of the rising air parcel, which drive other vertical motions (Figure ST.60e).  
    5. Taken together, there is a circulation. Namely, the air parcel is rising because of its buoyancy, and there is a circulation of the surrounding environmental air out of the way above the parcel, and filling back in under the parcel (Figure ST.60e). In real life, this circulation develops smoothly and continuously as the warm parcel begins to rise, and creates only small pressure changes, not a complete vacuum.  
    6. In this particular example, the circulation was driven by buoyancy in the vertical. However, similar circulations develop that are driven by horizontal pressure gradients. Namely, air parcels that are forced horizontally will cause vertical circulations to move the surrounding air out of the way and to deposit it back behind the air parcel. Thus, vertical and horizontal motions are linked, by the effect of continuity.
    7. **SUMMARY:** Forces create winds. Temperature alters buoyancy, to create vertical winds. Temperature alters pressure, to drive horizontal winds. Continuity links vertical and horizontal winds into circulations.
  12. **Describe rain and hail hazards of thunderstorms, and state actions you can take to be safe near thunderstorms.**
    1. **Hail** - Also falling out of the strongest thunderstorms can be hail, which are irregularly shaped balls of ice. The size of hail can range from the size of peas to the size of baseballs. The larger ones can cause extreme crop damage, break car damage, and cause severe injuries if they hit people. Hail can come from any large thunderstorm, but are most common with supercells (low precipitation storms).
    2. Normal precipitation forms when small ice crystals near the top of the thunderstorm fall in the downdraft regions into warmer air, where they melt and continue down as rain. The larger the raindrop, the deeper the cloud that it fell from (which is why we see large drops from deep thunderstorms, and smaller droplets and drizzle from the thinner nimbostratus clouds).
    3. Hail forms when the small ice crystals near the top of the thunderstorm re-circulate and fall down into the updraft region, instead of the downdraft region. This allows them to accumulate many layers of ice, growing like layers of an onion. Because hailstones are so heavy, thunderstorms need to have very strong updrafts, and the hailstones often fall out very close to the updraft part of the storm. Rarely, hail has been observed to fall from the anvil of a thunderstorm.
    4. Hail is difficult to forecast and The damage path left by a moving hailstorm is called a **hail swath**.
    5. How to be safe during a hailstorm:
      1. get indoors
      2. leave the hail area or get under a roof
      3. if exposed to strong hail, pull over and park + close eyes to keep eyes safe.
    6. **Downpour (Rain)**. Thunderstorm rain can be heavy, covering only small areas. Raindrops are usually very
large, but it is very transient as it moves with the storm. Some hazards from downpours are:
      1. flash floods
      2. reduced visiblity while driving
      3. rain-triggered landslides
    7. to be safe during downpurs:
      1. move to high ground
      2. don't drive through water of unknown depth

  13. **Be able to recognize tornadoes and wall clouds.**
    1. **Tornadoes** are violently rotating columns of air in contact with the ground. All violent tornadoes come from **supercell thunderstorms** (see unit B), particularly those thunderstorms that are rotating as **mesocyclones**.
    2. Most tornadoes are made visible by cloud-water droplets (the **funnel cloud**) and/or by dust and debris from the ground (the **debris cloud** on page 95). Some tornadoes are invisible.
    3. There are two types of motion of tornadoes: their translation speed and their rotation speed.
      1. Tornadoes usually move (**translate**) from the SW toward the NE in North America, although movement toward any direction has been observed. This is the speed that the tornado sweeps across the countryside, and is tied to the speed that its parent thunderstorm is moving. **Translation speeds** of the center of the tornado have been observed between 0 and 100 km/hr, although most move at speeds near the middle of that range (50 km/hr). Namely, you can easily drive away from most tornadoes in your car (pick a road perpendicular to the tornado track). If you watch a tornado for a short while and it doesn't appear to be moving left or right, then take immediate shelter because it could be moving directly towards you but you can't recognize that fact until too late!
      2. **Rotational (tangential) speeds** around the tornado center are much faster, and are what cause the destruction. These speeds can be faster than 500 km/hr in the strongest tornadoes.
    4. An isolated lowering of the cloud base, beneath the rising cumulus towers on the southwest flank of the storm, is called a **wall cloud**. This is usually outside of (SW of) the precipitation region of the cloud. Wall clouds in supercells sometimes rotate, and it is from these rotating wall clouds that tornadoes form. Hence, if you see a wall cloud, you should take warning because a tornado is very likely. **Figure on page 108**
    5. If you are a storm chaser and can drive to different places, the best place to view thunderstorms is off to the side of the storm path. The preferred side is to be the southeast of the storm, so that you can look at the storm toward the northwest, while remaining safe because the storm is not moving toward you (usually)
    6.  Tornadoes often go through a common evolution (see sketch below on page 112). Early in its life cycle, a funnel cloud (an actual cloud made of water droplets) may not yet be visible, but the rotation could be already started and kicking up some dust and debris. Later, if the tornado continues to strengthen, the rotating funnel cloud grows down from the base of the thunderstorm, and merges with the debris cloud from the ground. Near the end of the life cycle, tornadoes often decrease into a "rope" stage, where they are long, thin and bent or twisted. During the dissipating stage of the first tornado, beware of possible new tornadoes forming nearby.
  14. **Explain why supercell thunderstorms spawn the most dangerous tornadoes.**
    1. When the whole supercell storm rotates, it is called a mesocyclone. These rotating storms are the ones most likely to spawn tornadoes.
  15. **Relate the Enhanced Fujita scale to different amounts of damage.**
    1. **Tornado intensity** in North America is usually classified by the **Enhanced Fujita scale**, which is only based on the amount of damage to buildings.  Hence, classification by the Enhanced Fujita scale is possible only after the tornado has occurred, and the damage has been inspected. The scale ranges from **EF0** through **EF5**. **EF5 **is an exceptionally strong tornado that can totally destroy whole buildings, and **EF0** is a very weak tornado that might break a few windows. Although **EF6** and greater tornadoes are possible, they are impossible to determine from damage estimates because they all cause the same total destruction as an **EF5** tornado.
  16. **Describe safety procedures near tornadoes.**
    1. Tornadoes are usually very short lived (minutes), and have a damage path that is narrow (usually with width of a single house, up to the size of a city block). Rarely are tornadoes observed to last for hours, or to have damage paths 1 km or more wide. The damage paths are often one to tens of kilometers long, with some extreme paths of hundreds of kilometers long.
    2. The safest place to be, if a tornado is approaching you, is below ground in a basement or storm cellar. Some new homes in tornado alley are built with a closet designed as a "safe room", made of reinforced concrete walls and ceiling. This can be used as an aboveground tornado shelter if there is no basement.
    3. Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to thunderstorm and tornadic winds, and are the worse place to be in a tornado. You should immediately evacuate a mobile home if a tornado is approaching, and move to either a substantial permanent shelter, or get into a ditch.
    4. If caught outdoors on foot with a tornado approaching, find a ditch or hole to get into, to place your body below the "line of fire" of all the fast moving debris blown by the storm. If in a car, just drive away from the tornado on the best convenient road, preferably to the right or left of the translation direction of the tornado. Do not hide under a highway bridge or overpass.

  17. **Identify the times and places for high tornado risk.**
    1. Tornadoes are always attached to thunderstorms (see figures below). However, only a small percentage of thunderstorms have tornadoes. In North America, most thunderstorms move from the southwest toward the northeast. So this is the direction that tornadoes move also.
    2. If you are a storm chaser and can drive to different places, the best place to view thunderstorms is off to the side of the storm path. The preferred side is to be the southeast of the storm, so that you can look at the storm toward the northwest, while remaining safe because the storm is not moving toward you (usually)
  18. **Identify the components of a hurricane.**
    1. Hurricanes are made up of thunderstorms.
    2. Around the relatively-calm **eye** of the hurricane is a ring of thunderstorms called the **eye wall**
    3. From the eye wall are additional bands of thunderstorms that spiral outward, called **spiral bands**. Most individual thunderstorms are roughly 15 km in diameter, but hurricanes are typically 150 to 300 km in diameter.
    4. Check out diagram on page 122
    5. In the eye of the hurricane is exceptionally low pressure near the surface. Low-altitude winds (boundary-layer winds) blow counterclockwise (in the Northern Hemisphere) around the hurricane eye and spiral inwards. Wind speeds increase as the air gets closer to the eye wall, eventually exceeding the hurricane-criterion speed of 33 m/s.
  19. **Explain how hurricanes get and utilize heat energy, and why hurricanes can exist for weeks.**
    1. As humid boundary-layer air rises in the thunderstorms of the eyewall, there is copious amounts of condensation, resulting in exceptionally heavy precipitation falling out of those thunderstorms. With this condensation is the release of tremendous amounts of latent heat. The net result is that the eye and eye wall, known together as the core of the storm, are warmer than the surrounding air. This is known as a **warm core**.
    2. This means that at the top of the hurricane, the pressure in the core is higher than the surrounding pressure at the same altitude which results in a pressure-gradient force. this allows the hurricane to push air outward from to core which allows the pressure to remain low in the core. (similar to Continuity).
    3. **SUMMARY**:Why can hurricanes last for weeks, in spite of all the air molecules continually being blown into the core?  
Heavy condensation and precipitation from thunderstorms in the eye wall cause the hurricane core (eye + eye wall) to become very warm (lots of energy!) relative to its surroundings.
  20. **List the requirements for hurricane existence, describe how hurricanes evolve, and what causes them to die.**
    1. **Tropical Cyclones - Organized to Create Their Own Fuel**
      1. thunderstorms use the warm, humid boundary-layer air as fuel. However, most thunderstorms are usually short lived (about an hour or less), because after consuming the nearby supplies of boundary layer air, they run out of fuel and die.
      2. the exception is when the ambient atmosphere happens to have the right amount of wind shear to continually advect fresh fuel into the storm. Such shear in the environment can also move the thunderstorm to new regions where there still is boundary-layer fuel. Supercell thunderstorms work in this way. Hurricanes are one step more advanced than thunderstorms. Instead of relying on a serendipitous environmental wind to maintain a long-lasting supply of fuel, the hurricane manipulates the environment to continually create the fuel needed by its bands of thunderstorms. It does this by tapping into the heat stored in the ocean.
      3. Low pressure in the eye of the hurricanes sucks boundary layer air into it. As this air gets closer and closer to the eye, it moves faster and faster, as already discussed. Faster winds create larger waves on the ocean surface. Evaporation from the ocean surface, enhanced with spray from the waves, adds significant amounts of moisture into the boundary- layer air. Thus, by the time the boundary-layer air reaches the base of the eye wall, it is warm and exceptionally humid (near 100% relative humidity), and thus contains tremendous amounts of sensible and latent-heat fuel needed by the eye-wall thunderstorms (see figure below on page 123).
      4. In order for this process to work, the ocean surface temperatures must be warmer than 26 °C. Also, these warm surface waters must be roughly 60 m deep or more, so that the turbulent mixing within the ocean caused by the surface waves doesn't mix up colder waters to the surface. Such deep, warm layers of ocean water often form in the tropics during summer, where there is maximum heating from the sun. **Thus, hurricanes usually occur in late summer and in early Fall, when there is maximum extent and depth of warm waters**.
      5. The constant supply of thunderstorm fuel (boundary-layer air) continues only as long as:
        1. there is low pressure in the hurricane eye to suck in the air to create the large ocean waves (Low pressure is synergistically maintained by the thunderstorms that make up the hurricane, as is described in the next subsection.); and
        2. the hurricane remains over the warm ocean
      6. If the hurricane moves either over colder water or over land, then it cannot generate sufficient warm, humid air to serve as fuel, and the hurricane weakens and dies (see figures below on page 125).
      7. In addition to warm surface waters, hurricanes need to extract rotation from the Earth's rotation. At the equator this effect, known as the **Coriolis effect**, is zero; hence, hurricanes cannot form and cannot cross the equator. The Coriolis effect increases as you move away from the equator. Thus, hurricanes are most likely to form between latitudes of 10 degrees and 30 degrees, where there is both warm sea-surface temperature and non-zero Coriolis force.
      8. Over the Atlantic Ocean, hurricanes that form in this latitude belt are steered by winds blowing around the semi- permanent **Bermuda High** (see figure below on page 127). This circulation blows incipient hurricanes from off the west coast of Africa toward the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and Florida. A large Bermuda High circulation turns the storms more northward near the East Coast of North America. As a result, hurricanes strike the Gulf Coast States and SE Coastal States.
      9. **SUMMARY (on page 136)**: 
        1. Hurricanes consist of spiral bands of thunderstorms around an eye of low pressure. Hurricanes do more than CONSUME fuel (sensible and latent heat in air) to power their violent motions -- they CREATE new fuel within the boundary-layer air that is drawn inward while over warm, deep ocean waters in the tropics.  
        2. To maintain this circulation, latent heating in the eye wall is so intense, it creates a warm core within the storm. This warm core produces a high pressure at the top center of the storm that removes air aloft as fast as it comes in from below.  
        3. Thus, hurricanes can exist for roughly a week, until they move over colder waters or land, where they no longer have their fuel supply. On land, the greatest threat to life and property is the sea-level rise associated with the storm surge.
  21. **Describe the risks associated with hurricanes, and appropriate safety procedures.**
    1. Of the small portion of Atlantic hurricanes that move toward Canada, most weaken below hurricane strength before they arrive. **The main reason is the very cold ocean water** just off the coasts of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.
    2. As we have learned, simply knowing past hurricane conditions and their tracks is NOT the best predictor. Computer models must also depend on current atmospheric and sea surface conditions to make forecasts. Despite these huge amount of available data however, various computer models of the atmosphere still end up with conflicting forecasts, especially for predictions that extend beyond the predictive capability of the models, i.e. beyond the average 48-hour period. We must be aware of these limitations and understand that there will always be uncertainty in extreme weather predictions until the event, the hurricane, gets close to shore.
    3. Knowing that hurricane predictions are inaccurate means that forecast maps of hurricane danger usually include probabilities, as shown in the figure below. Note how the probability that the predictions are accurate are highest over a very small area of the hurricanes immediate travel path. There probabilities quickly decrease forward in time.
    4. What can you do to keep yourself and your family safe from hurricanes? Here are two preventative recommendations:
      1. Don't buy or build houses on or near the beach in southeastern USA
      2. Plan in advance for evacuation. Do NOT even think that you can "ride out the storm"

Hurrican intensity is given by the **Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale**: this scale categorizes hurricanes based on the wind speed. Ranges from category 1 to 5 where 1 is minimal and 5 is catastrophic.

#Module: The Shaking Earth - Earthquakes  
1. **Describe the global distribution of earthquakes and how often quakes of various magnitudes occur**
  1. In british columbia, around 1413/365 = 3.87 quakes per day.
  2. Vast majority of earthquakes were less than magnitude 4
  3. **The vast majority of earthquakes occur at the margins of Earth's tectonic plates.**
  4. very largest of recorded earthquakes have all occurred on the edges where continents meet oceans
2. **Understand the different types of faulting at different plate boundaries, and which plate boundaries produce the largest quakes**
  1. a **fault** is a region where rocks have broken over some area
  2. 4 types of plate boundaries:
    1. Divergent: 
      1. plates are moving apart, leading to tension or stretching. Due to the tensional forces, rocks break and many small(ish) earthquakes occur. 
      2. occurs at mid-ocean ridges or spreading centres.
      3. **Dip-slip faults (normal faults)**: are those where the side leaning on its neighbour drops down, as might be expected if gravity had it's way.
    2. Transform:
      1. plates move past each other, leading to shearing forces between plates. Rocks are being sheared, thus many earthquakes occur here
      2. These are moderate to large 'quakes, but not as large as those that occur in the next 2 boundary types below.
      3. **Strike-slip Faults**
    3. Convergent: (Produces the largest quakes)
      1. type 1:
        1.  plates move toward each other and collide, leading to compression.
        2.  In this type, one of the plates is less dense than the other (see examples below). Thus, one plate subducts or dives under the other at subduction zones.
        3.  Rocks are compressed and extensive small to very large earthquakes occur. In fact, the largest earthquakes occur at subduction zones.
      2.  type 2:
        1. plates move toward each other and collide, leading to compression.
        2. Here, neither plate is subducting or plunging, thus the plates crumple up like a rug being pushed together. Rocks are compressed and extensive small to very large earthquakes occur.
      3. **Dip-slip faults (reverse faults)**: are those where the side leaning on its neighbour moves up.
3. **Describe how the Earth builds, stores, and releases energy in earthquakes (elastic rebound)**
  1. The **size/strength** of an earthquake (called it's magnitude) is related to the energy released when it occurs.
  1. **Brittle deformation**:Consider a wooden stick being bent until it breaks. As forces applied to the material increase, the material stores the energy, i.e. we say that stress is accumulating. When the stress (force per unit area) exceeds the strength of the material, the material breaks. The accumulated energy is rapidly released as heat, motion, and sound. (Sound waves radiate away as pressure waves from the breaking stick).
  2. This is effectively a "catastrophic" release of energy. When rocks break catastrophically after accumulating stress over time, the resulting motion is called an **earthquake**. The energy is dissipated in the form of waves (i.e., the various types of seismic waves) that radiates away from the location of breakage.
  3. an earthquake of magnitude 7 involves approximately **32 times as much energy** as a magnitude 6 earthquake. 
  4. There are three conditions that affect the amount of energy released during an earthquake:
    1. Area of zone broken
    2. Strength of rocks being broken 
    3. Amount of motion
4. **Understand concepts of (1) stress causing strain and (2) plastic versus brittle deformation**
  1. **Stress** refers to the force per unit area while **strain** describes how materials change shape as a result of the stresses involved.
    1. Stress can be broken down into 3 forces:
      1. compressional forces - those that cause squeezing
      2. tensional forces - those that cause a pulling apart of material
      3. shear forces- those that cause twisting or shearing
  2. plastic versus brittle deformation:
    1. **Plastic deformation** occurs when the applied force permanently changes the shape of a rock without "breaking" it. 
    2. **Brittle deformation**: Consider a wooden stick being bent until it breaks. As forces applied to the material increase, the material stores the energy, i.e. we say that stress is accumulating. When the stress (force per unit area) exceeds the strength of the material, the material breaks.
5. **Describe how the rupture propagates from the focus and why shaking and damage are not necessarily greatest at the epicenter**
  1. **hypocentre** (point where energy was released; also called the **focus**)
  2. This has to do with the type/characteristics of the ground.
6. **Describe the different types of seismic waves and how they move through the Earth**
  1. The energy released from faults is converted to wave energy. And the seismic wave types include:
    1. **Body waves**: travel through the interior of materials. There are two forms of body waves. The distinction is based on the type of particle motion associated with the wave.
      1. When particles move back and forth in line with the direction the waves are traveling, the wave is called a **pressure or primary wave**. These are more commonly referred to as **P-waves**.
      2. When particles move from side to side, perpendicular to the direction that waves are traveling, the wave is called a shear or **secondary wave**. These are referred to as **S-waves.** S-waves travel slower than P-waves, hence the terms "primary" and "secondary" to characterize rate of energy transfer. **Cannot** travel through liquids.
    2. **Surface waves**: travel only along surfaces (rather than through materials) and are generated when P and S-waves arrive at the Earth's surface. The energy can not continue on into air, so some are reflected back down and the rest of the energy pushes and pulls the particles of the ground near the surface resulting in generation of Rayleigh and Love waves. They then travel along the surface, causing the damage we are all so worried about. **Surface waves are much slower than body waves**, and the energy carried by them can not depart from the surface along which they are traveling. **these are the waves with the largest amplitude of motion. These waves cause the most damage.**
      1. Wave energy that travels along boundaries (rather than through materials) is called **surface wave energy**.
      2. **Rayleigh wave**: particles experience a backward-rotating motion that is in line with the wave's direction. These are the waves that **cause the most damage** because they are largest, and they are most clearly felt because they travel along the Earth's surface. 
      3. **Love waves**: particles experience a side-to-side motion that is perpendicular to the wave's direction. This side-to-side motion is in a horizontal plane roughly parallel to the Earth's surface. Diagrams on page 44.
      4. Note how Rayleigh waves cause motion in the x-z plane, which is perpendicular to the surface of the Earth. Love waves cause motion in the x-y plane, which is parallel to the surface of the Earth.
    3. All 4 wave types travel at their own velocity, and the whole pattern of energy resulting from an earthquake becomes very complicated very soon after the event.
    4. Waves' energy dissipates as they travel because rocks are not perfectly elastic. Seismic wave energy starts out as a very complicated mixture of all frequencies. The highest frequencies dissipate more quickly as waves travel through Earth's materials.
      1.  Waves recorded nearby include high frequencies, whereas those recorded at locations that are more distant consist only of lower frequency waves. The more distant signals are also weaker, but this may not always be easy to tell since amplifiers are used to boost the traces.
7. **Understand the principle behind early warning systems (such as the one in Japan) and how much warning time they can give**
8. **Describe how an earthquake is recorded and how to locate the epicenter**
  1. Earthquake is recorded by analyzing the seismic signals pattern and its important key features (which is the relative times of arrival of P-waves and S-waves). Seismograms.
  1. The main features that must be identified to locate an earthquake are the **relative times that P- waves and S-waves arrive**. P-waves travel about 1.7 times faster than S-waves. Thus, the greater the difference in arrival times between these 2 wave types, the farther away the recording is from the earthquake origin.
  2. If one distance is estimated, the earthquake location could be anywhere on a circle with radius equal to the distance from the seismometer (equivalent to the compass's point in the figure). If three distances (epicentre to seismometer) can be estimated, the resulting three circles will intersect at the only possible location of the epicentre.
9. **Understand how local ground conditions can affect the duration and amplitude of shaking**
10. **Compare and contrast the meanings and uses of earthquake magnitude and intensity scales**
  1. The amount of energy at the source describes the magnitude (wattage of the light bulb), whereas the experience felt as a result of that energy is the "felt intensity" (amount of light at the place it is used).
11. **Explain the different magnitude scales, which one is best for large quakes, and why**
  1. Other **nomograms** or equations (similar but with different coefficients) would be needed to find magnitude from seismograms in different situations, or if a different part of the seismogram was to be used (such as the P-wave amplitude or the S-wave amplitude rather than surface wave amplitude). 
12. **Explain factors that determine earthquake intensity**
  1. Earthquake magnitude:  Larger earthquakes have a much greater capacity to be catastrophic. However, this is only true if they occur near human activity.
  2. duration of shaking: Longer shaking will cause more damage.
  3. distance from epicentre/hypocentre: It is clear in this instance that the closer to the epicentre/hypocentre, the more likely that intensity is large. However, this is definitely not always true. Other factors do affect intensity.
  4. ground type: Ground type is very important. Harder rocks are stiffer and generally experience smaller motions. Additionally, all frequencies of a seismic signal (high and low) pass more easily in hard rocks. Softer rocks in the same location, however are likely to experience larger motions. Higher frequencies also tend to decay more quickly in softer rocks.
  5. building characteristics: One more very important aspect of felt motion, and breaking structures, is the buildings themselves. Of course, stronger buildings will suffer less than poorly constructed ones. However, another factor, which is equally important, is resonance.
    1. Frequency at which an object perfers to wobble is called its "resonant" frequency
    2. If the building is made to shake at exactly it's resonant frequency, the building's motion will increase rapidly, causing it to break much more quickly than if it is forced to move at a rate that is not close to it's resonant frequency.
    3. Factors other than height determine resonant frequency. For example, stiffer buildings have higher resonant frequencies, more flexible buildings have lower resonant frequencies, and increased mass (related to its weight) lowers the resonant frequency.
    4. One other important aspect of a building's response to earthquake ground motion is the behaviour of adjacent buildings.
13. **Be aware of how earthquakes can be the cause of other natural disasters (e.g., tsunamis, liquefaction, landslides)**
14. **Understand the basics of how buildings can be designed or retrofitted to better resist earthquakes (and reduce casualties)**
  1. structures are NOT built to withstand horizontal acceleration (side-to-side motion caused by surface waves). 
  2. Two general approach:
    1. static methods: make it stronger; simply add strength in the form of cross braces, shear walls (walls with good shear or side-to-side strength), and shear cores (a central zone with added shear strength)
    2. dynamic methods:
      1. Absorb energy (damping): use of springs/shock absorbers (dampers) to absorb energy 
      2. Add mass (change resonance)
      3. Isolate building from ground: rubber foundation blocks for buildings allow the earth to move without dragging the structure with it
15. **Identify fault zones that could produce an earthquake damaging to Vancouver**
  1. Cascadia:
    1. tectonic setting is optimal for large subduction zone earthquakes. Juan de Fuca plate is subducting under the North American plate and we know the largest earthquakes occur at subduction zones.
16. **Explain what we can and cannot predict about large earthquakes**
  1. We know where most (but not all!) faults are, and our knowledge of plate tectonics is sophisticated enough now that we know where plates move relative to each other. 
  2. HOWEVER... very few faults are so well studied.
  3. Additionally, faults are complex. Even the most well studied fault in the world, the San Andreas in California, is a very complicated feature. All known faults around the bend in the San Andreas are shown in the next figure, but there are also hidden faults in this system. So, yes, this fault is active, and earthquakes will occur along it. We have the answer for "Where?", but only to a very rough estimate. "Where exactly?" Which of the many associated branches, parallel and spawned faults will be the next to move?
17. **Know the difference between forecasting and prediction**
  1. Prediction is too general a term. It implies making precise statements of what will happen in the future. Definitely not reasonable.
  2. Forecasting is a more reasonable term. Depending on the type of environment, weather forecasting is usually accurate for the next 24 hours, pretty good for 5 days, and begins to get less reliable further into the future. Earthquake forecasting on similar time scales would be quite useful. Anticipating events months or years in advance would be even more useful.
18. **Make informed decisions about earthquake safety - how to act, how to prepare**
  1. **Before an Earthquake**: Look around you!
    1. Retrofit your home: put secure latches on cabinet doors; connect bookcases and wall units to the wall; store breakable or heavy objects on lower shelves; put anti-skid pads under heavy objects such as TVs, microwaves, etc.
    2. Keep your home safe: learn how to shut off the gas, water, and electricity; strap water heaters to walls; keep flammable and other hazardous liquids away from the house
    3. Identify safe spots - under a sturdy desk
    4. Prepare an earthquake kit. Here are some items to consider including in your kit: tent, water, flashlight, radio, food, first aid kit, money, candles, etc
    5. Determine seismic hazard at your site.
  2. **DURING an Earthquake**:
    1. Stay calm: DON'T PANIC
    2. Get out of areas where flying objects could cause injury (for example the kitchen, study/library, areas with glass windows)
    3. Stay under strong tables or desks (remember: Duck, Cover, Hold)
    4. Failing that, stand under archways or the inside corner of a room
    5. Avoid doorways!
    6. Do not move until the shaking stops
  3. **AFTER an Earthquake**:
    1. Deep breaths!
    2. Help the injured (or get help)
    3. Get out of damaged buildings
    4. Do not use the phone if possible
    5. Be prepared to survive on your own; Help might not be available for at least 3 (or more) days
      1. Find food, water, supplies, equipment to help the injured
      2. Fill a bathtub with water as your reserve
      3. Use other sources of water: water heaters, melted ice cubes, the toilet tank

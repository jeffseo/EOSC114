#Module: The Shaking Earth - Earthquakes  
1. **Describe the global distribution of earthquakes and how often quakes of various magnitudes occur**
  1. In british columbia, around 1413/365 = 3.87 quakes per day.
  2. Vast majority of earthquakes were less than magnitude 4
  3. **The vast majority of earthquakes occur at the margins of Earth's tectonic plates.**
  4. very largest of recorded earthquakes have all occurred on the edges where continents meet oceans
2. **Understand the different types of faulting at different plate boundaries, and which plate boundaries produce the largest quakes**
  1. 4 types of plate boundaries:
    1. Divergent:
      1. plates are moving apart, leading to tension or stretching. Due to the tensional forces, rocks break and many small(ish) earthquakes occur. 
      2. occurs at mid-ocean ridges or spreading centres.
    2. Transform:
      1. plates move past each other, leading to shearing forces between plates. Rocks are being sheared, thus many earthquakes occur here
      2. These are moderate to large 'quakes, but not as large as those that occur in the next 2 boundary types below.
    3. Convergent type 1:
      1.  plates move toward each other and collide, leading to compression.
      2.  In this type, one of the plates is less dense than the other (see examples below). Thus, one plate subducts or dives under the other at subduction zones.
      3.  Rocks are compressed and extensive small to very large earthquakes occur. In fact, the largest earthquakes occur at subduction zones.
    4. Convergent type 2:
      1. plates move toward each other and collide, leading to compression.
      2. Here, neither plate is subducting or plunging, thus the plates crumple up like a rug being pushed together. Rocks are compressed and extensive small to very large earthquakes occur.
3. **Describe how the Earth builds, stores, and releases energy in earthquakes (elastic rebound)**
4. **Understand concepts of (1) stress causing strain and (2) plastic versus brittle deformation**
5. **Describe how the rupture propagates from the focus and why shaking and damage are not necessarily greatest at the epicenter**
6. **Describe the different types of seismic waves and how they move through the Earth**
7. **Understand the principle behind early warning systems (such as the one in Japan) and how much warning time they can give**
8. **Describe how an earthquake is recorded and how to locate the epicenter**
9. **Understand how local ground conditions can affect the duration and amplitude of shaking**
10. **Compare and contrast the meanings and uses of earthquake magnitude and intensity scales**
11. **Explain the different magnitude scales, which one is best for large quakes, and why**
12. **Explain factors that determine earthquake intensity**
13. **Be aware of how earthquakes can be the cause of other natural disasters (e.g., tsunamis, liquefaction, landslides)**
14. **Understand the basics of how buildings can be designed or retrofitted to better resist earthquakes (and reduce casualties)**
15. **Identify fault zones that could produce an earthquake damaging to Vancouver**
16. **Explain what we can and cannot predict about large earthquakes**
17. **Know the difference between forecasting and prediction**
18. **Make informed decisions about earthquake safety - how to act, how to prepare**

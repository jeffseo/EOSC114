#Module: The Shaking Earth - Earthquakes  
1. Describe the global distribution of earthquakes and how often quakes of various magnitudes occur
2. Understand the different types of faulting at different plate boundaries, and which plate boundaries produce the largest quakes
3. Describe how the Earth builds, stores, and releases energy in earthquakes (elastic rebound)
4. Understand concepts of (1) stress causing strain and (2) plastic versus brittle deformation
5. Describe how the rupture propagates from the focus and why shaking and damage are not necessarily greatest at the epicenter
6. Describe the different types of seismic waves and how they move through the Earth
7. Understand the principle behind early warning systems (such as the one in Japan) and how much warning time they can give
8. Describe how an earthquake is recorded and how to locate the epicenter
9. Understand how local ground conditions can affect the duration and amplitude of shaking
10. Compare and contrast the meanings and uses of earthquake magnitude and intensity scales
11. Explain the different magnitude scales, which one is best for large quakes, and why
12. Explain factors that determine earthquake intensity
13. Be aware of how earthquakes can be the cause of other natural disasters (e.g., tsunamis, liquefaction, landslides)
14. Understand the basics of how buildings can be designed or retrofitted to better resist earthquakes (and reduce casualties)
15. Identify fault zones that could produce an earthquake damaging to Vancouver
16. Explain what we can and cannot predict about large earthquakes
17. Know the difference between forecasting and prediction
18. Make informed decisions about earthquake safety - how to act, how to prepare

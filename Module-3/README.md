#Module: The Explosive Earth - Volcanoes
1. **Explain what magma density and magma viscosity are.**
  1. **Magma is formed by melting pre-existing rock in Earth's interior.** Melted rock is less dense than solid rock, so it will rise towards the surface of the Earth. Some magmas are trapped in the crust, whereas other magmas travel through fractures in the crust and eventually extrude onto Earth's surface.
  2. For magma to rise through the crust it must be: 
    1. Less dense than the crust
    2. Runny enough to flow (i.e., it must have low viscosity)
    3. Hot enough to stay liquid. 
    4. All these properties depend on the magma's composition and temperature.
2. **List the different categories of volcanic rocks and explain the differences between the magmas they came from.**
  1. **Lava flows** - Lava flows result when magma that is relatively low in gas content (less than a few percent) erupts effusively at Earth's surface.
    1. pahoehoe - ropy-textured surface a of lava flow
    2. 'a'a - rubble-y flow top consisting of broken fragment of lava
  2. **volcanic glass** -  In some cases magma erupts and cools so quickly that crystallization does not occur. The magma solidifies into glass, a supercooled liquid. Glass is not crystalline, although volcanic glass may contain some microscopic crystals of common minerals. This glass is called **obsidian** if it is massive, or **pumice** if it contained many bubbles (called **vesicles**). The bubbles form from gas that escaped from the magma during eruption.
  3. **Pyroclastic Material** - Pyroclastic (Greek for "fire piece", or hot fragment) material refers to fragments of all sizes that are erupted explosively out of a volcano. These range from the finest material, **ash** (< 2 mm diameter) through **lapilli** (2 - 64 mm) to larger **blocks** and **bombs** (> 64 mm). Many pieces of pumice are actually pumice lapilli.
  4. **Gaseous Products** - Gaseous compounds bubble out of magma during eruptions and form vesicles in the solid rock. H2O (steam) is by far the most common volcanic gas, but CO2 (carbon dioxide), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), H2S (hydrogen sulfide), and HCl (hydrogen chloride) are other important volcanic gasses. H2S gives volcanic gas its rotten egg smell. CO2, is a colorless, odorless gas, and is denser than air and thus may accumulate in low areas. When inhaled at concentrations much higher than usual atmospheric levels (0.0385% or 385 ppmv) , it can produce a sour taste in the mouth and a stinging sensation in the nose and throat.
3. **Explain why some magmas erupt explosively (as pyroclastic material) and some magmas erupt effusively (as lava).**
  1. Factors influencing explositivity:
    1. **Gas content** - Magma with higher gas contents have more explosive, and thus more hazardous, eruptions. As magmas rise towards Earth's surface, dissolved gases, which are compressed at depth, expand and try to escape the magma. Gas bubbles are formed, grow larger, and eventually explode.
    2. **Viscosity** - the resistance to flow. The more easily magma flows, the more likely it is that gas bubbles in it will dissipate and the magma will erupt effusively rather than explosively. Therefore, **the combination of high gas content and high viscosity leads to the most explosive volcanic eruptions**. Factors affecting viscosity include:
      1. **Chemical composition** of magma. Magmas have varying amount if SiO2: the moer SiO2, the higher the viscosity.
      2. **temperature** - As magma cools, more Si-O bonds form, and the magma is said to polymerize. this makes magma stickier and thicker as it cools, or in other words, more viscous.
      3. viscosity is proportional to the weight percent of SiO2 in magma; and
      4. viscosity is proportional to 1/T of magma, where T = temperature
    3. **Mafic magmas** (those with the lowest SiO2 content) exist at high temperatures, have the lowest viscosity, have low gas contents, and tend to erupt effusively (non-explosively). They form dark colored mafic rocks called **basalts**.
    4. **Felsic magmas** form at lower temperatures, have high viscosity, and tend to erupt explosively. They form lighter-colored felsic rocks called **rhyolites**. Felsic magmas also tend to have higher gas contents than mafic magmas, and it is this combination of high viscosity and high gas content that leads to explosive eruptions.
4. **Explain the differences between pahoehoe and a'a lavas.**
    1. pahoehoe - ropy-textured surface a of lava flow
    2. 'a'a - rubble-y flow top consisting of broken fragment of lava flow
5. **Describe the different types of volcanic eruptions and how they are related to magma properties.**
  1. A **volcano** is a mass of material that forms at Earth's surface in response to one or more eruptions of magma. Most volcanoes form hills or mountains. Within a volcano is a **crater**, a steep-walled, bowl-shaped depression surrounding the volcanic vent from which new material erupts.
  2. Check page 19 for diagram of relationship.
  3. Magma physical properties such as viscosity are dependent on chemical composition. Mafic magmas with low silica have low viscosity; they tend to erupt quietly as lava flows and form landforms such as shield volcanoes and cinder cones.
  4. Felsic magmas have high viscosity. Because of their high viscosity and high gas content, most felsic magmas erupt explosively as pyroclastic material. This can be in the form of ballistic fragments, pyroclastic flows, or ash falls. Felsic magmas are found in landforms such as composite volcanoes, domes, and calderas.

6. **Describe the morphology, dominant rock type and typical eruption style of the different types of volcanoes.**
  1. **Mafic volcanic landforms: Shield Volcanoes and Cinder Cones**
    1. Mafic lavas are very fluid (low viscosity) and can travel long distances from a vent. They may flow downhill at speeds of up to 30 km/hr, and travel tens to over one hundred kilometers from their vent.
    2. **Shield volcano**: One common mafic volcanic landform is the shield volcano. It is tens of kilometers high and may be over 100 km across. Early observers thought that the shape of this type of volcano, which is much larger in diameter than it is high, reminded them of the shape of a Viking's shield, hence the name. Repeated eruption of **basaltic lava flows** forms most of a shield volcano, although small eruptive centers called cinder cones (see below) are present on the flanks.
    3. **Cinder Cones**: A cinder cone is a conical hill formed from the **accumulation of pyroclastic material** (cinders are 4 - 32 mm in size) around a volcanic vent. The cones are commonly 10's to 100's of meters high and 100's of meters across. One or more **lava flows** may issue from the vent after the cone forms. In general, cinder cones are composed of mafic magma, although andesitic cinder cones are not unknown.
  2. **Intermediate to felsic volcanic landforms: Stratovolcanoes**
    1. When intermediate to felsic magma erupts explosively, it can produce **ash columns** that penetrate to higher than 40 km into the atmosphere. Ash is the finest grained pyroclastic material, and if it gets into the stratosphere, it can travel around the world in upper level winds. When the winds die, ash falls out of the atmosphere due to gravity and it forms layers that blanket the landscape.
    2. **Stratovolcano**: also known as a **composite volcano**, is composed of alternating layers of lava flows and pyroclastic layers, along with volcanic domes (see below) and tabular intrusions known as **dykes** and **sills**. These volcanoes are tall, conical, and have steep slopes. They can be several kilometers high and over 10 km across. Composite volcanoes get their name because they erupt magmas of a full range of silica contents. The mafic and some intermediate eruptions tend to form flows, whereas magmas with higher silica contents commonly erupt explosively as pyroclastic material, either in the form of bombs, flows, or falls.
    3. **Lava dome**:  A dome is a pile of viscous lava that forms over a vent. It commonly has a mushroom-like shape because the lava is viscous and does not travel far from the vent. Domes may stand alone, or be erupted in the center or on the flank of an existing volcano.
  3. **Felsic volcanic landform: Calderas**
    1. **Caldera.** One type of volcano that is dominantly felsic is known as a caldera. Calderas are very large depressions in Earth's crust, caused by voluminous eruption of explosive, felsic pyroclastic material. They are typically 10's to over 100 km across and kilometers deep. Calderas form because so much magma is erupted that the existing crust founders into the void left by the evacuated magma chamber.
    2. Calderas are the most explosive volcanoes, expending tremendous amount of energy on the landscape. Luckily for us, they erupt infrequently in terms of our lifetimes.
7. **Explain what lava flows, fire fountains, lava bombs, and volcanic ash are and how they form.**
  1. **Lava flows**: Low viscosity mafic lava flows can flow and spread laterally out of a stream canyon onto a valley floor. They erupt at 1200 - 1400 Â°C. However, they are NOT explosive. Most people are able to run out of the way or avoid a particular valley through which a flow is progressing. Thus, the main hazard associated with mafic flows is infrastructure damage. Road and buildings are easily overrun and incinerated.
  2. **Fire fountains**: Sometimes, basaltic lava can contain lots of gas which create **small** explosive eruptions called **fire fountains**. As partially liquid drops fall back to the ground, they may coalesce to re-form a lava flow
  3. **lava bombs**: the largest pyroclasts (> 64mm in diameter). **Bombs and blocks** are explosively ejected during an eruption as ballistic projectiles, most of which land near the volcanic vent.
  3. **volcanic ash**: the smallest pyroclasts (< 2 mm diameter). These form from fragmentation of a frothy magma, when the pressure within the gas bubbles exceeds the strength of the viscous magma (which is when it explodes).
8. **Describe the particular hazards associated with lava flows, fire fountaining, lava bombs, and ash fall.**
  1. **Lava flows**: the main hazard associated with mafic flows is infrastructure damage. Road and buildings are easily overrun and incinerated.
  2. **lava bombs**: boom boom !
  3. **volcanic ash**: 
    1. During explosive volcanic eruptions, ash falls downwind of the volcano. In the case of very large eruptions, ash columns may rise to altitudes of > 40 km, where the fine ash particles are picked up by global winds and circulated around the world. This allows for ash to be deposited over a vast area. Ash injected into the stratosphere can contribute to a lower amount of solar radiation reaching Earth's surface, and therefore to global cooling.
    2. Ash can choke vehicle and airplane engines, aggravate respiratory ailments, bury homes and other structures and/or cause their collapse, and cover valuable agricultural land, thereby decreasing the food supply and leading to famine.
9. **Explain what pyroclastic flows, lahars, volcanic domes, sector collapses, lateral blasts, and toxic gases are and how they form.**
  1. **Pyroclastic flows**: Pyroclastic flows are turbulent mixtures of hot gas and pyroclastic fragments that are emplaced laterally from a volcanic vent. They consist of ash, lapilli, crystals, and other rock fragments called **lithic fragments**. These flows are density currents that move at speeds of 300 - 400 km/hr. The largest pyroclastic flows can travel 10's of kilometers from their source. The temperature of a pyroclastic flow is generally in the 500 - 700 Â°C range.
    1. Pyroclastic flows tend to be confined to low areas in the topography such as stream valleys radiating from a volcanic cone. 
    2. Pyroclastic flows originate in several ways. The most common way is by collapse of an eruption column. 
    3. Another method is by sudden collapse of part of an erupting **volcanic dome**.
    3. when a small pyroclastic eruption builds up and overspills the crater rim resulting in a high-speed flow of pyroclastic materials.
    4. failure of one side of a volcanic edifice may lead to a lateral blast of pyroclastic material which then flows down slope.
  2. **Lahar**:  Lahars or volcanic mud or debris flows are extremely destructive mixtures of water, ash, rock fragments of all sizes, and debris that travel swiftly down slope from a volcano, at speeds up to 50 km/hr. They follow stream valleys. Some lahars are hot when they are emplaced because they are associated with pyroclastic eruptions, but other lahars may occur long after volcanic activity has ceased.
    1. As mentioned earlier, formation of a lahar requires the following: pyroclastic material and water. Lots of water! The water may come from melted snow and ice high on the flanks of a volcano.
  3. **Toxic Gasses**:Toxic gases may be released by a volcano during or between active eruptions. Many types of gas are emitted from volcanoes, but water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are the most common components. Other gases include sulfur
dioxide (SO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and hydrogen chloride (HCl). About 1 - 10% of a magma consists of gas.
  4. **Volcanic Landslide (Sector collapse)**: a down slope failure of a portion of a volcanic edifice. Eruptive products that compose the volcano are altered to clay minerals by hydrothermal fluids. Clays have low shear strength. The combination of water percolating into the volcano (either from rain, melted snow, or hot springs) combined with clay can lead to failure under the influence of gravity with no warning or precursor activity. Volcanic landslides may turn into mudflows or debris flows down slope.
    1. Volcanic landslides can be triggered by volcanic activity, earthquakes, rapid melting of snow and ice, or heavy rainfall events.

10. **Describe the particular hazards associated with pyroclastic flows, lahars, dome collapses, sector collapses, lateral blasts, and toxic gases.**
  1. **Pyroclastic flows**: Pyroclastic flows are the most lethal of the eruptive products. These flow mostly along channels, ridges, and valleys, but can also jump the banks as it travels at high speed over tens of kilometres. Effects from pyroclastic flows are mostly limited to the immediate vicinity of the source volcano, but all life and structures in its path are destroyed.
  2. **Lahar**: Roads, bridges, houses, livestock, and people may all be caught up in their destructive path. They do a lot of damage because they travel long distances away from a volcano so their presence may not be associated with it, and they can occur in between times of volcanic activity.
    1. Some volcanic eruptions can cause their own micro-weather system which can result in lahars. Water, a common gaseous product of eruption, can be blown high into the atmosphere as steam, eventually to fall as heavy rain. Rain falling on thick accumulations of pyroclastic material on steep slopes set off lahars. This sequence of events buried the city of Herculaneum days after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.
  3. **Toxic Gasses**: 
    1.  SO2 may combine with H2O to form dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This in turn forms "acid rain" which can destroy crops, leach heavy metals from steel structures, nails, and paint, and contaminate cisterns full of drinking water.
    2.  CO2 is dangerous because it is denser than air and can accumulate in low areas. sudden release of large amount of CO2 that was trapped can kill people/crops.
  4. **Sector Collapses (Volcanic landslide)**: landslide can lead to a debris avalanche which can be devastating.
  5. **SUMMARY**: Volcanoes may have multiple types of eruptions and thus the hazards at a volcano will vary with time. Not all volcanic hazards are directly associated with explosive eruptions; even mafic lava flows are dangerous if observers are not careful. Neither are all volcanic hazards directly associated with eruptions; lahars may occur without warning during times of volcanic quiescence.
11. **Explain how the size of a volcanic eruption is estimated.**
  1. **Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)**: provide a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions and to classify eruptions as to their potential for disaster. (0: non-explosive explosion to 8: mega-colossal explosive eruption) It considers:
    1. **volume** of eruption products;
    2. eruption **plume or cloud height**;
    3. **duration** of eruption; and
    4. **qualitative observations** (with terms that range from non-explosive, gentle, cataclysmic, to mega-colossal)
12. **List the different volcano monitoring techniques and the instruments that are used.**
  1. **Volcano Monitoring Strategy**. Scientists monitor volcanic activity to detect and measure changes in its state caused by magma movement beneath the volcano. Rising magma typically will:
    1. trigger **swarms of earthquakes** and other types of seismic events; 
    2. cause **swelling or subsidence** of a volcano's summit or flanks; and 
    3. lead to the release of **volcanic gases** from the ground and vents
  2. Techniques include:
    1. **Seismic monitoring**: The **most useful technique** for predicting volcanic activity.
      1. Increased seismic activity is associated with eruptions or precursor activity before eruptions. The location, frequency, and types of earthquakes are all important. As buoyant magma rises through the crust, it fractures the overlying rock to make room for itself. This causes concentrations of earthquakes in space and time.
      2. Pre-eruption 'quakes are typically swarms consisting of dozens to hundreds of events, M < 5, and increasing in frequency or intensity as an eruption is imminent. These quakes occur closer to the eruption location and become shallower as eruption nears.
      2. **Acoustic flow monitors**: are a specialized type of seismometer that are optimized to detect and record high frequency (10 - 250 Hz) vibrations caused by lahars, rather than lower frequency vibrations in the 0.5 - 10 Hz range that are typical of earthquakes.
    2. **Ground deformation**: A volcano changes shape when magma and/or gas moves into a reservoir beneath or within the volcanic edifice.
      1. Simple, inexpensive, yet effective **direct measurements of horizontal displacement** can be made by physically taping the distance between two metal stakes
      2. **Tiltmeters** are sensitive instruments that record changes in the tilt of a surface. These instruments are placed around the flanks of a volcano and the change in tilt is measured over time.
      3. **The Global Positioning System (GPS)** can be used to pinpoint horizontal and vertical movement of targets on a volcano through repeated measurements over time.
      4. A safer but more expensive way of making ground deformation measurements is to use **InSAR (satellite radar interferometry)**. This technique involves satellites using radar waves to measure the elevation of large areas of the crust in the vicinity of active volcanoes over an interval of time.
    3. **Increased gas emissions:** Increased gas emissions may reflect a change in magma supply rate, a change in the type of magma that is erupting, or a change in the underground fracture system that is routing gas towards the surface. Volcanoes typically record 2 - 3 orders of magnitude increase in SO2 emissions during or prior to an eruption.
      1. **Direct collection of gases** emitted at fumaroles is possible, but in an active volcanic setting this may be getting too close for comfort for most people!
      2. the **correlation spectrometer (COSPEC)** allows us to estimate SO2 emissions in an eruption plume from afar and thus with little danger. A COSPEC **measures** the amount of solar ultraviolet light absorbed by sulfur dioxide and compares it to a standard.
      3. **Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR)** is a third technique commonly used in sampling and measuring gas emissions from volcanoes. The FTIR analyzes several gases simultaneously and uses a mathematical process (the Fourier transform) to convert the raw data into the desired format, the amount of light absorbed at each wavelength.
    4. **Visible signs of volcanic activity**:
      1. **Still photography and video footage** are used extensively to document changes to active volcanoes.
      2. **LIDAR (light detection and ranging)** images such as the one of the dome at Mount St. Helens in September - October, 2004 (Figure below) can be used to calculate the volume of new material added over time.
    5. **Increased heat flow**: Increased heat flow from a volcano may indicate the presence of new magma at the surface, fracturing of the crust due to magma upwelling, or increased activity at hot springs and/or fumaroles.
      1. **Direct observations** of glowing magma or glowing cracks in a volcano are certainly possible. An **optical pyrometer**, a hand-held device, may be used to determine the temperature of glowing lava.
      2. **Aerial remote sensing of infrared spectra** can record anomalously hot areas.
      3. **Forward looking infrared (FLIR)** images, taken by airplanes or satellites, are also being used extensively to monitor dome growth at Mount St. Helens.
      4. **Remote Sensing (Satellite) Monitoring Strategies.**
13. **Explain what a volcanic hazard map is and why they are useful.**
  1. Spatial data for a volcano, such as the distribution of eruptive units, are plotted on a geologic map. The map is then used to identify hazards, based on past history, and to produce a **volcanic hazards map** showing zones of likely eruptive activity, and specific hazards.
14. **Use your knowledge of volcanic processes to map major hazards around different volcanoes. **
15. **Evaluate the hazards to Vancouver associated with an eruption from Mount Baker.**
16. **Describe the distribution of the world's active volcanoes.**
17. **List the three types of plate boundaries and the different types of volcanoes that occur at these plate boundaries.**
18. **Describe the type of volcanoes that occur at oceanic and continental hot spots.**
19. **Describe the tectonic setting of British Columbia and determine the dominant type of volcano that occurs here.**

Extra: 
  1. Anatomy of an Explosive Eruption (page 12):
    1. High silica magma forms in the crust by melting of pre- existing rock. Gas is dissolved in this magma due to the high pressure underground.
    2. The magma rises towards Earth's surface because it is less dense than the surrounding solid rock.
    3. As the magma rises, the dissolved gas expands and forms bubbles in the magma. This process is called **vesiculation**.
    4. Because the magma is also cooling at it rises, its viscosity is increasing (Si-O bonds are forming). The gas bubbles are trapped in the viscous magma and gas pressure builds within the bubbles as they get closer to the surface.
    5. When the percentage of the bubbles in the magma is about 75%, they are close enough that they touch. The walls between adjacent bubbles are so thin that the gas pressure overcomes the viscosity of the magma.
    6. BOOM! An explosive eruption takes place, and fragments of magma are erupted as pyroclasts.  
  
  If the magma was mafic (low in silica content), the included gas bubbles would be able to escape from the rising magma and pop easily upon eruption, resulting in less explosive eruptions.

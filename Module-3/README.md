#Module: The Explosive Earth - Volcanoes
1. **Explain what magma density and magma viscosity are.**
2. **List the different categories of volcanic rocks and explain the differences between the magmas they came from.**
3. **Explain why some magmas erupt explosively (as pyroclastic material) and some magmas erupt effusively (as lava).**
4. **Explain the differences between pahoehoe and a'a lavas.**
5. **Describe the different types of volcanic eruptions and how they are related to magma properties.**
6. **Describe the morphology, dominant rock type and typical eruption style of the different types of volcanoes.**
7. **Explain what lava flows, fire fountains, lava bombs, and volcanic ash are and how they form.**
8. **Describe the particular hazards associated with lava flows, fire fountaining, lava bombs, and ash fall.**
9. **Explain what pyroclastic flows, lahars, volcanic domes, sector collapses, lateral blasts, and toxic gases are and how they form.**
10. **Describe the particular hazards associated with pyroclastic flows, lahars, dome collapses, sector collapses, lateral blasts, and toxic gases.**
11. **Explain how the size of a volcanic eruption is estimated.**
12. **List the different volcano monitoring techniques and the instruments that are used.**
13. **Explain what a volcanic hazard map is and why they are useful.**
14. **Use your knowledge of volcanic processes to map major hazards around different volcanoes. O. Evaluate the hazards to Vancouver associated with an eruption from Mount Baker.**
15. **Describe the distribution of the world's active volcanoes.**
16. **List the three types of plate boundaries and the different types of volcanoes that occur at these plate boundaries.**
17. **Describe the type of volcanoes that occur at oceanic and continental hot spots.**
18. **Describe the tectonic setting of British Columbia and determine the dominant type of volcano that occurs here.**

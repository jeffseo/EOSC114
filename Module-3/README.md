#Module: The Explosive Earth - Volcanoes
1. **Explain what magma density and magma viscosity are.**
  1. **Magma is formed by melting pre-existing rock in Earth's interior.** Melted rock is less dense than solid rock, so it will rise towards the surface of the Earth. Some magmas are trapped in the crust, whereas other magmas travel through fractures in the crust and eventually extrude onto Earth's surface.
  2. For magma to rise through the crust it must be: 
    1. Less dense than the crust
    2. Runny enough to flow (i.e., it must have low viscosity)
    3. Hot enough to stay liquid. 
    4. All these properties depend on the magma's composition and temperature.
2. **List the different categories of volcanic rocks and explain the differences between the magmas they came from.**
  1. **Lava flows** - Lava flows result when magma that is relatively low in gas content (less than a few percent) erupts effusively at Earth's surface.
    1. pahoehoe - ropy-textured surface a of lava flow
    2. 'a'a - rubble-y flow top consisting of broken fragment of lava
  2. **volcanic glass** -  In some cases magma erupts and cools so quickly that crystallization does not occur. The magma solidifies into glass, a supercooled liquid. Glass is not crystalline, although volcanic glass may contain some microscopic crystals of common minerals. This glass is called **obsidian** if it is massive, or **pumice** if it contained many bubbles (called **vesicles**). The bubbles form from gas that escaped from the magma during eruption.
  3. **Pyroclastic Material** - Pyroclastic (Greek for "fire piece", or hot fragment) material refers to fragments of all sizes that are erupted explosively out of a volcano. These range from the finest material, **ash** (< 2 mm diameter) through **lapilli** (2 - 64 mm) to larger **blocks** and **bombs** (> 64 mm). Many pieces of pumice are actually pumice lapilli.
  4. **Gaseous Products** - Gaseous compounds bubble out of magma during eruptions and form vesicles in the solid rock. H2O (steam) is by far the most common volcanic gas, but CO2 (carbon dioxide), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), H2S (hydrogen sulfide), and HCl (hydrogen chloride) are other important volcanic gasses. H2S gives volcanic gas its rotten egg smell. CO2, is a colorless, odorless gas, and is denser than air and thus may accumulate in low areas. When inhaled at concentrations much higher than usual atmospheric levels (0.0385% or 385 ppmv) , it can produce a sour taste in the mouth and a stinging sensation in the nose and throat.
3. **Explain why some magmas erupt explosively (as pyroclastic material) and some magmas erupt effusively (as lava).**
  1. Factors influencing explositivity:
    1. **Gas content** - Magma with higher gas contents have more explosive, and thus more hazardous, eruptions. As magmas rise towards Earth's surface, dissolved gases, which are compressed at depth, expand and try to escape the magma. Gas bubbles are formed, grow larger, and eventually explode.
    2. **Viscosity** - the resistance to flow. The more easily magma flows, the more likely it is that gas bubbles in it will dissipate and the magma will erupt effusively rather than explosively. Therefore, **the combination of high gas content and high viscosity leads to the most explosive volcanic eruptions**. Factors affecting viscosity include:
      1. **Chemical composition** of magma. Magmas have varying amount if SiO2: the moer SiO2, the higher the viscosity.
      2. **temperature** - As magma cools, more Si-O bonds form, and the magma is said to polymerize. this makes magma stickier and thicker as it cools, or in other words, more viscous.
4. **Explain the differences between pahoehoe and a'a lavas.**
5. **Describe the different types of volcanic eruptions and how they are related to magma properties.**
6. **Describe the morphology, dominant rock type and typical eruption style of the different types of volcanoes.**
7. **Explain what lava flows, fire fountains, lava bombs, and volcanic ash are and how they form.**
8. **Describe the particular hazards associated with lava flows, fire fountaining, lava bombs, and ash fall.**
9. **Explain what pyroclastic flows, lahars, volcanic domes, sector collapses, lateral blasts, and toxic gases are and how they form.**
10. **Describe the particular hazards associated with pyroclastic flows, lahars, dome collapses, sector collapses, lateral blasts, and toxic gases.**
11. **Explain how the size of a volcanic eruption is estimated.**
12. **List the different volcano monitoring techniques and the instruments that are used.**
13. **Explain what a volcanic hazard map is and why they are useful.**
14. **Use your knowledge of volcanic processes to map major hazards around different volcanoes. O. Evaluate the hazards to Vancouver associated with an eruption from Mount Baker.**
15. **Describe the distribution of the world's active volcanoes.**
16. **List the three types of plate boundaries and the different types of volcanoes that occur at these plate boundaries.**
17. **Describe the type of volcanoes that occur at oceanic and continental hot spots.**
18. **Describe the tectonic setting of British Columbia and determine the dominant type of volcano that occurs here.**

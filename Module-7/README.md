#Impacts from Space and Mass Extinction Events  

**Learning Goals:**  

**A. Understand the concept of a biosphere and Earth System Science and that the biosphere has evolved over time**  
A **mass extinction** is a crisis that affects life right across the planet from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains. It is helpful when trying to imagine such an event to consider all life on Earth as being part of the **biosphere**, a thin layer of life that exists on the surface of the planet and that interacts with the hydrosphere (oceans, lakes and rivers), the atmosphere, and the lithosphere (the Earth's crust).  

We notice that the biosphere has evolved through time in that the ocean creatures are different from the past compared to now but both demonstrate an active marine community and diverse biosphere.  

You can think of life and the biosphere as a play that has been running for millions of years in which the cast of actors has changed from time to time. The biosphere is composed of millions of individual species. As the components of the biosphere (individual species) evolve or go into extinction over time the biosphere evolves and changes.  

**B. Distinguish between the oldest and youngest portion of a geological section using the Principles of Superposition, Original Horizontality, and Cross-cutting Relationships**  
**The Principle of Superposition**. This is a fundamental principle of stratigraphy (the study of rock layers) that was devised by Nicholas Steno in 1669. Basically, Steno states that in a succession of layered rocks, the rock layer at the bottom of the pile will be the oldest and the layer at the top the youngest. Effectively, "What's on top is youngest". In the figure below, the rocks at the bottom of the photograph will be older than those at the top.  


**C. Describe the concept of faunal succession and the use of fossils in correlation and in the subdivision of Earth history**  
**Principle of Faunal Succession.** This was devised by William Smith in 1799 who recognized that strata (a series or layers of rocks in the ground) of like age can be recognized by the fossils they contain even if the outcrops of strata are separated by large distances geographically. This only works because **species have evolved through time**. Using the appearance and disappearance of fossils to subdivide geological time is the science of **biostratigraphy**. Each fossil species is said to have a **range** through geological time. In other words, it exists in the geological record from the point that it evolves to the point that it becomes extinct.  

**D. Recognize the qualities that make fossils useful in biostratigraphy**  
>This only works because **species have evolved through time**. Using the appearance and disappearance of fossils to subdivide geological time is the science of **biostratigraphy**. Each fossil species is said to have a **range** through geological time. In other words, it exists in the geological record from the point that it evolves to the point that it becomes extinct.

**E. Identify important historical figures in the development of stratigraphy and biostratigraphy**  
  1. James Ussher (1581 - 1665) : calculated Earth to be 6000 years old through studying the bible.
  2. George Cuvier (1769 - 1832) : examined remains of mammoths in Europe and concluded they were **once living** species that had become extinct.

**F. Appreciate the scale of changes that can occur over geological time scales**  

**G. List some of the major subdivisions / ages of the geological time scale and appreciate the relative scale between the Phanerozoic and the Precambrian**  
Today we have a time scale that divides and subdivides Earth's 4.6 billion years into various time periods (see figure below). In the figure, the subdivisions of time are called (starting from the left-most column to the right on **page 9**) 
  1. Eons: Precambrian and Phanerozoic, 
  2. Eras: Archean, Proterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, and 
  3. Periods: from the oldest, Cambrian, to the most recent, the Neogene.  
  
Note that the **Precambrian**, when compared to **Phanerozoic**, is far less subdivided even though it represents the majority of Earth's history. This is due to an **extraordinary proliferation of fossils** at the base of the Phanerozoic in a period called the Cambrian.  

It was here that most of the creatures with **hard parts** like shells, teeth, and internal skeletons evolved. Fossils with hard parts fossilize much more readily than soft-bodied creatures. So, in addition to an increasing biodiversity as new species evolved, many of the new "hard part creatures" would more readily form fossils. Consequently the Phanerozoic is more finely subdivided that the Precambrian.  

**H. Understand how extinction events are linked to the structure of the geological time scale**  
  1. **Eras** are broad subdivisions that are particularly significant. They represent a grouping of geological periods. These major groupings are not placed arbitrarily but represent times when there has been a major change in the Earth's **biosphere**.
  2. As mentioned above, the base of the Phanerozoic is defined by the emergence of creatures with hard parts. The base of the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic, however, are based on the **emergence of new species following a mass extinction** at the top of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic respectively.
  3. The base of all periods is defined on the emergence or **radiation** of new species.  

  
**I. List some of the major developments in the history of life on Earth**  
**￼￼￼￼J. Define the characteristics of a mass extinction**
For an event to be considered as a mass extinction, it must be according to the following:
  1. **At least 30%** of Earth's species must be lost
  2. It must be across a **broad range of ecologies**, not restricted to any one niche
  3. It must have a **short/sudden duration** (around 1 million years maximum)

Example: The extinction of 45% of all species over 500 000 years is considered a MASS EXTINCTION
**K. List the "Big Five" mass extinction events and their order through time**  
  1. Cretaceous / Paleogene (Tertiary) (K/Pg), 65 Ma 
  2. Late Triassic, 205 Ma
  3. Permo / Triassic, 251 Ma
  4. Late Devonian, 360-375 Ma
  5. Late Ordovician, 440-450 Ma

Which pair of extinction events "bracket" the time of the dinosaurs?  
*Permo-Triassic and Cretaceous-Paleogene* (from 251 Ma to 65 Ma as shown in the image on page 9)  
**L. Distinguish between broad extinction-producing phenomena**  
Causes of Mass extinctions:
  1. Biological causes - Organisms being brought together that once lived in isolation can cause mass extinctions. For
example, many of the New Zealand ground dwelling bird fauna were devastated when human hunters and then later European mammals (cats, rats, dogs) were introduced. The three main modes of a biologically induced extinction are:
    1. **Competition** between creatures occupying the same ecological niche
    2. (excessive) **Predation**: Predators do not have to do the whole job, just drive a population to a low enough level then "random extinction" can complete the extinction. The idea behind a random extinction is that, although the number of individuals in a species may grow and the species may spread over a wide area, nothing ensures the permanent survival of a species.
    3. **Pathogens**: disease being introduced to an area by incoming plants or animals
  2. **Earth-based causes** - Extinctions influenced by Earth-based tectonic processes may be caused by changes in
continental configuration or changes in atmospheric composition.
    1. **Changes in continental configuration**. Changes in the distribution of continents can have a profound effect. Two major effects of continental configuration are detailed below.
      1. **Changes in climate, ocean cyclicity, sea level**. Weather patterns and the movement of the oceans are directly linked to the distribution of continents.  
      eg. **The Late Ordovician Extinction.**  
Gondwana (a continent consisting of South America, Africa, Antarctica, India, and Australia; see figure below) moves towards the South Pole during the late Ordovician causing a severe ice age. As water was locked up in the form of glaciers at the Southern Pole, sea level fell. This may have had a severe effect on creatures that lived in the shallow water close to the continental margins. As the sea retreated off the continental shelf and into the ocean basins, shallow marine ecosystems would have been devastated.
      2. **The greater the landmass the lower the diversity**. At the moment we have a relatively high biodiversity. This is in part due to the number of continents that are in effect isolated from one another. In times when there is a high degree of continental fragmentation, evolution can proceed in isolation to produce many different species on different landmasses. If plate tectonics causes the formation of a large interconnected land mass there will be more competition between species and lower biodiversity.  
      eg. **The Permo / Triassic Extinction**  
At the end of the Permian, plate tectonics had brought all the continents together to form the super continent of Pangaea (see figure below).  
    2. **Changes in the atmosphere** In addition to the climatic effects due to continental configuration, volcanic activity can also have severe effects. Gases such as carbon dioxide can cause greenhouse warming and aerosols may cause climatic cooling. These can significantly affect the health of the biota.  
  3. **Extraterrestrial impacts** discussed later on
  4. **Combination of many factors** It is very unlikely that any one factor would be responsible for a global crisis in the biosphere. A combination of events and circumstances are generally recognized as being the cause of mass extinction events. This will be described more fully as we learn about the Permo-Triassic Extinction.  

**M. Describe the late Ordovician and Permo-Triassic extinction**  
  1. Permo Triassic extinction (251 Ma) is considered the WORST "day" for the biosphere as between 95-98% of all species would go into extinction. It hit both ocean- and land-based ecosystems and was less than 1 million years in duration. The cause includes a number of events coming together at the same time. The following is expected:
    1. **Continental configuration: drop in biodiversity.** As discussed previously, the greater the landmass the greater the competition between species. At the end of the Permian, the supercontinent of Pangaea or "all lands" would have brought many species into direct competition.
    2. **Sea level fall: less ocean ridge activity.** Sea floor spreading slowed its pace during the Permian. As a result, the oceanic ridges were smaller in size and displaced less water. Consequently oceans retreated from shallow areas into the deeper basin causing problems for creatures that lived in any remaining shallow marine environments.
    3. **Oceanic stagnation.** The close of the formation of Pangaea saw the end of an ice age. Cold polar waters probably disappeared and ocean circulation slowed or stopped. This would have reduced ventilation of deep ocean waters killing off many deeper marine species. In addition occasional overturn of stagnant water could have brought oxygen poor waters to shallower marine communities as well.
    4. **Climate change.** Due to the formation of a large landmass, climate would have been much drier and subject to drought.
    5. **Siberian Traps: massive volcanic activity in Russia.** Around 2 - 3 million km3 basaltic lava were produced within a million years. Carbon dioxide from the volcanic activity and methane caused by melting of gas hydrates would have resulted in greenhouse warming of the planet. In addition, gas emission from volcanoes would have also produced acid rain effects.
    6. **Possible impacts.** Although still very controversial, it is possible that the Earth suffered impacts from space during this time as well.
  2. late Ordovician extinction is discussed in previous question

**N. Describe the character of extinctions at the K/Pg boundary**  
The Cretaceous - Paleogene (K/Pg) Extinction Event - At the end of the Cretaceous, many creatures, including the dinosaurs, went into extinction. Just as the end of the **Permian** extinction marked the beginning of a new grouping of periods (the **Mesozoic**) the end of the **Cretaceous** extinction is likewise so distinct that it marks the beginning of the latest grouping of periods, the **Cenozoic**.  

Over 50% of all species would go into extinction during the K/Pg event. On land, few creatures over 25 kg in weight would survive. In general the extinction was even more severe in the oceans with around 80 - 90% of marine species including the ammonites and marine reptiles going into extinction.

The K/Pg is also well known for its association with a major extra- terrestrial impact event. The Alvarez team was investigating a clay layer that occurs in a geological section that crosses the K/Pg boundary in Gubbio, Italy. The 1-cm clay layer lies directly on top of the latest Cretaceous rocks and was found to be enriched in the element iridium. Iridium is very rare at the Earth's surface and yet in this layer was enriched over 300× above background. This iridium anomaly has now been recorded in many other sections around the world that straddle the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary.  

Iridium is known to exist in higher concentrations in extra-terrestrial objects such as asteroids. Alvarez suggested that the clay layer enriched in iridium has been produced by a meteor or comet over 10 km in diameter impacting the Earth. He suggested further that this impact may have also been responsible for the extinction at the end of the Cretaceous.  

**O. Discuss the evidence used to support the K/Pg impact**  
  1. **Fern spores vs. Pollen** - Ferns are often the first plants to colonize a landscape that has been devastated by fire. In the earliest Paleogene (part of what was formerly called the Tertiary), many areas show an increase in fern spores relative to pollen (see figure below). This suggests that global forest fires may have raged at the end of the Cretaceous leaving a landscape open for ferns to spread. This is further supported by high concentrations of soot found around the K/Pg boundary.
  2. **Tektites** - thought to be produced during an impact event. They are composed of natural glass. During impact, rock is melted and ejected from the crater. As it travels through the air and cools, it forms characteristic aerodynamic shapes. Many tektites are found at the K/Pg boundary in many different locations, again suggesting a massive impact event.
  3. **Shocked Quartz** - In many sections around the K/Pg boundary, fragments of the mineral quartz show evidence of multiple fractures. These fractures are thought to be produced when rock is shattered during a high-energy impact. The fragments are called shocked quartz.
  4. **Tsunami deposits** - Tsunami waves leave characteristic sedimentary deposits on inundated shores and as far inland as the waves reach. This feature was found in Mexico, Texas, New Jersey, and the Carolinas suggesting the passage of an enormous wave, far larger than could have been produced by standard tectonic processes. Such a wave could have been generated if an impact had occurred in the ocean.  

**P. Describe the location and probable nature of the K/Pg impactor**  
In the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, the Chicxulub Impact Crater has been confirmed to be from the K/Pg event.  

The object responsible for this crater had a shallow angle of entry around 20 – 30° and is estimated to have been at least 10 km across. As an analogy, you can think of something the size of Mount Everest hitting the surface of the planet. The energy
released by the impact was equivalent to 6.2 × 107 tons of TNT. An estimated 100 km3 of rock was vaporized and released to the atmosphere. Material that wasn't instantly vaporized was thrown out of the crater (the ejecta) and was deposited to the NW of the impact site.  

**Q. Describe the initial and long-term effects of the impact and their environmental consequences**  
  1. **Initial effects**(seconds to days) of the impact in the area of the Yucatan Peninsula were significant.
    1. Everything close by would have been vaporized.
    2. The intense heat from the blast and the hot debris (including tektites) would have started massive forest fires as suggested by the fern and pollen data.
    3. As the impact occurred partly in the ocean, a massive tsunami would have been generated.
  2. **Longer-term effects**(months to decades) of the impact were numerous. Two significant effects were on global temperature and on atmospheric composition.
    1. Global temperature changes
      1. Dust thrown into the atmosphere would have shut off sunlight for weeks or perhaps months generating a period of cold (a "**Cold House**"), lasting weeks to months. The lack of sunlight would also have had severe consequences for plants and photosynthetic algae.
      2. After the dust had settled, water vapour would have remained in the atmosphere acting as a blanket, preventing heat from escaping the Earth. This would have created a greenhouse effect and caused a rise in global temperature.
      3. Eventually the excess water vapour would be removed by rainfall. However, the temperature of the Earth would continue to rise due to the release of greenhouse gases during impact (a "Hot House"), lasting years to decades. In particular, carbon dioxide would have been liberated when large quantities of limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) would have vaporized during the impact.  

      The Mesozoic had in general been a warm equable environment. These swings in temperature would have placed a lot of stress on creatures more used to stable climatic conditions.
    2. Acid rain
      1. High-energy blasts can cause oxygen to combine with nitrogen to form **oxides of nitrogen**. When these are dissolved in water (i.e., rainfall), it becomes **nitric acid**.
      2. In addition to the vaporization of limestone as described in (a) above, rocks called evaporites were also vaporized in the blast. Evaporites form when salts precipitate out of solution as the sun evaporates a body of water. This can occur on a vast scale, for example in the Mediterranean Sea, which is closed off at the Strait of Gibraltar. With virtually no input of water from the Atlantic Ocean, high rates of evaporation resulted in the Sea being converted into a vast saltpan. This process had also occurred in the Yucatan area.  
  
The effect of high-energy blasts on sulfate-rich evaporites is the release of large amounts of sulfur gases. These gases, when dissolved in rainwater, fall to Earth as **sulfuric acid**.

Although the acidity of the nitric- and sulfuric-containing rain was weak and could probably not affect any large animals directly, they would have affected the acidity of soil and the surface ocean.  

This would have had a devastating effect on plant life and plankton. Thus, the effects from acid rain on the organisms that form the **base of the food chain or food web** had serious repercussions for all the creatures at higher trophic levels. For reference on how a food chain/food web operates, see a modern example below.

**R. Consider other potential causes of the K/Pg environmental collapse**  
  1. During the late Cretaceous, the supercontinent of Pangaea was starting to fragment. This would have caused changes in oceanic circulation and climate.
  2. Even more significantly, global climate would have been affected by an increase in volcanic activity, in particular, during the formation of the Deccan Traps in India, which were highly active at this time. Like the Siberian Traps that occurred at the end of the Permian, this activity would have produced vast quantities of gases that could have seriously affected the Earth's climate.  

The most appropriate conclusion we can derive from the observations made thus far is that the late Cretaceous biosphere was probably already stressed. The Chicxulub impact (or possibly others) acted as the "final nail in the coffin" taking an already "sick" biosphere further than it might have gone into a mass extinction event.  

The creatures most likely to survive all the changes in environmental conditions would have been the **generalists** who did not require specific foodstuffs or particular environments to thrive. It would also help if a creature were small enough to be able to hide or burrow away from the more severe environmental changes. On land, the creatures that were able to adapt to these changes were the **mammals**. And it is this group that will radiate into the Cenozoic to take over the niches vacated by the dinosaurs.  

**S. Describe the type and location of potential impactors and rate of meteor influx**  
Two general types of potential impactors:
  1. **Comets** - are essentially material left over from the formation of the Solar System and are composed of icy material and other debris - effectively "dirty snowballs" in space. As comets travel towards the Sun, the ices vaporize producing the comet's tail. comets may have been responsible for bringing much of the water and perhaps some of the organic compounds that would lead to the development of life on Earth. There are two comet "stores" in the Solar System:
    1. The Kuiper Belt exists in an area from about the orbit of Neptune to about 50 au's out (1 au = 150 million kilometres). Contains 1 billion comets that are greater than 5km in diameter.
    2. The Oort cloud is a cloud of comets that exists way beyond the Kuiper belt and is only weakly associated with our Sun. May have more than 200 comets with a diameter greater than 500km with many smaller but still significant in size.
  2. **Asteroids** are mostly found in a belt between the orbit of Mars and Jupiter. It is speculated that they may represent the material that might have formed another planet early in the history of the Solar System if it were not for the gravitational effects of Jupiter. a few are over 500 km in diameter, about 1000 have diameters greater than 30 km and 1 million (1 000 000 = 1 x 106) with diameters over 1 km.  

**Around 100 billion (100 000 000 000 = 1 x 1011) objects enter our atmosphere every 24 hours!** Most of these are burned out at a distance of 60 km above the Earth's surface. These objects are commonly traveling around 11 - 30 km / second. At such speeds, the atmosphere acts like a brick wall. If an object enters at a shallow angle, it may skip like a stone being skipped across a pond and fly back out to space.  

**T. List some of the major impact features preserved on the Earth’s surface and explain why impact craters appear to be rare on Earth**  
Early in Earth's history, our planet probably suffered multiple impacts. We can see this by observing the craters on the moon and some on our planetary neighbours' like Mercury. The evidence of this early bombardment is missing on Earth due to processes of erosion and active plate tectonics. Some Craters are believed to be from extinct volcanoes and not from impacts.  
Gene Shoemaker was to change this view by studying features such as the material thrown out of a crater (ejecta), shocked quartz, and chemical anomalies, which demonstrated extraterrestrial origins for these features. With the aid of satellite imagery, we are now beginning to identify more craters on the surface of our planet. A significant impact crater can be found in Northern Quebec, the **Manicouagan impact crater**. This formed about 214 million years ago in the Late Triassic. It is 70 km in diameter but was probably as wide as 100 km before glacial erosion stripped away the upper levels.  

This impact event is thought to be associated with 4 others including the **Saint Martin Crater** in Manitoba (40 km in diameter) and the **Rouchechouart Crater** in France (25 km in diameter). When the continents are reassembled into their locations during the late Triassic all these craters line up along 22.8 °N latitude over a distance of 462 km. It is thought that this almost improbable alignment may actually represent a fragmented body that generated several impacts. It is interesting to note that although the effects of this impact would have been severe, it is not associated with a major mass extinction event.

**U. Describe some of the features and processes of crater formation**  
**V. Provide examples of Canadian Impact Craters**  
**W. Describe the hypothesis proposed by Raup and Sepkoski**  
Two researchers, Raup and Sepkoski, produced some worrying data in 1984. They analyzed the number of mass extinctions during the Phanerozoic and concluded that every 25 million years there was severe stress on the biosphere, sometimes associated with a mass extinction event.  

There is no known terrestrial geological process that could cause this frequency of problems for the biosphere. So it was suggested that an extraterrestrial source may be to blame. In particular, comets in the Oort cloud were cited as being the most likely culprit. Raup and Sepkoski's hypothesis suggests that every 25 - 26 million years, something shifts the Oort cloud, which causes some comets to fall in towards the Sun and a possible impact with the Earth. For this to work, we need to identify a gravity source that can cause disturbances in the cloud on a regular 25-million year basis. Here are some of the hypotheses that have been proposed to account for the "Raup - Sepkoski" periodicity.  
  1. **Nemesis - Companion Star** - This hypothesis proposes that our Sun has a companion star way beyond the outer limits of our Solar System whose orbit brings it close to the Oort cloud every 25 million years. The gravitational effects of this close pass could cause comets to fall into the inner Solar System. If this body was a red dwarf star or even a black hole, it might be difficult to detect. However, even though powerful telescopes such as Hubble have the ability to see such faint objects, none have been found (yet).
  2. **Planet X** - Like the Nemesis hypothesis, this has an astronomical body (Planet X) that causes shifts in the Oort cloud as it orbits around the Sun. In this case, the body is a planet lying within the bounds of the Oort cloud but outside the Kuiper belt. Again, no evidence of such a planet has been found.
  3. **Movement Through the Galactic Plane** - In the same way that our planet orbits the Sun, so our Solar System orbits around the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. The figure below shows the position of our Solar System in one of the spiral arms of the galaxy. However, galaxies are not just flat pancakes of stars, they also have "thickness".  

In addition to traveling around our galaxy, our Solar System is also moving up and down through it. Every 25 - 26 million years we pass through the densest part of the galaxy, which contains a higher number of stars and also the most gravitational effects. It is proposed that it is this movement through the dense part of the galactic plane that is responsible for the shifts in the Oort cloud and thereby a potential impact related biosphere crisis every 25 million years or so.  
**X. List and describe some recent impacts and "near misses"**  
  1. **Tunguska, Siberia: June 30, 1908.** A large explosion about 8 km above the surface attributed to an extraterrestrial object breaking up in the atmosphere (which is why no crater was found). Fortunately, the area was not populated but people and horses 480 km away were knocked off their feet. The shock wave from the blast traveled around the Earth twice. In Scotland and Sweden, a light appeared in the sky so bright that you could read books at 2 AM without the aid of artificial light. It has been suggested that this might have been a fragment of comet Encke which was passing close by the Earth at the time.  

Over 80 million trees were knocked over covering an area about 2,150 km2. To properly understand the damage that could have occurred to a modern city, compare the area of the Tunguska devastation to that of the area occupied by Washington, D.C. in (figure below on page 33).
  2. **Asteroid near misses: 1989, 1996, 2009, 2011**
    1. March 22, 1989: A 500-m asteroid misses Earth by 6 hours. The impact crater would have been 7 km across.
    2. May 19, 1996: A 150-m diameter asteroid misses Earth by 430 000 km, a hair's breadth away in astronomical terms. The Crater would have been around 1 km in diameter (similar to Meteor Crater in the USA) and released twice the energy produced by Mount St. Helens in 1980.
    3. March 2, 2009, 5:44 AM Pacific Time (were you asleep?): Asteroid 2009 DD45, 40 m in diameter, buzzed about 70 000 km from Earth, about 1/5 of the distance between the Earth and the moon. The asteroid's size is comparable to that of the Tunguska impactor of 1908.
    4. November 7, 2011, 3:28 PM Pacific Time (point of closest approach): Asteroid 2005 YU55, a 70-metre wide asteroid was as close as 324,900 km (from the centre of the Earth). Scientists used this flyby as an opportunity to make observations of the asteroid's surface.
  3. **Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 Impact with Jupiter in 1994.** Not exactly close but still in the neighbourhood, was the impact of comet Shoemaker Levy 9 with Jupiter. The comet had been fragmented by Jupiter's strong gravity and crashed into the giant planet in a series of explosions between 16 - 22 July, 1994.  

This series of impacts was equivalent to several million megatons of TNT, enough energy to wipe out all but the simplest forms of life if the impact had occurred on Earth. It is thought that the **presence of Jupiter and our very large moon** has been significant in protecting the Earth from more frequent major impacts. It is probably these "impact shields" taking some of the hits Earth might have suffered that have permitted our biosphere to become as complex and diverse as it is today.  

**Y. Understand the risk associated with an impact hazard**  
The periodicity of a potential "city killer" impact is random but statistically could occur around once every million years. The risk of being killed in an impact event by a body around 1 km or greater in the next 50 years is about **1:20,000**. This is the same level risk of being killed in an air crash! These numbers are similar due to the way risks are calculated. Both the frequency of the event and the potential number of deaths are a factor. For an air crash, the frequency is high but the number of deaths is low while for an impact event, frequency is relatively low but deaths potentially very high.  

The most important factor in preventing an impact on Earth is **TIME**. We need time to know which objects are a potential risk. Then we need **lots of time** to make appropriate plans and to build what we need for our defense. The Spaceguard Survey at NASA has analyzed space objects with diameters greater than 1 km. 90% of potential impactors are near-Earth asteroids or short period comets with another 10% being intermediate or long period comets (greater than 200-year return periods).  

Check page 34 to see the **Torino Scale** which is used to assess the risk of near-Earth objects (NEOs). Goes from 0 (No hazard) to 10 (Certain Collisions).  

**Z. List possible mitigation strategies and appraise their relative effectiveness**  
The impact hazard is unique. It is potentially the most devastating but the **only** disaster that can be completely avoided. The most important factor in all the following strategies is **TIME**. We need to have a long warning period of potential impact, which makes projects like Spaceguard vital. Below are selected impact mitigation strategies that have been proposed.
  1. **Fragmentation** - Destroy approaching impactor with nuclear weapons. If impactor is metallic, may have to resort to drilling into the object to deploy the weapon. There is no guarantee that the fragments produced from explosion would not still impact the planet.
  2. **Sudden Orbit Adjustment** - this would involve exploding a nuclear warhead in front or on the surface of an approaching body to adjust its trajectory so it is no longer an impact threat. Such a solution is still rather unpredictable.
  3. **Steady State Orbit Adjustment** - These strategies would require more warning time but would permit adjustment of the orbit of the approaching object in a more predictable manner.
    1. Attach chemical or nuclear rocks to the object to gently nudge it out of the way.
    2. Deploy robot "mass drivers" to land on the surface of the object. These would excavate material and launch it off the surface. This action would act as a form of propulsion and slowly change the approaching object's trajectory.
    3. Ablation systems: irradiate the surface with lasers or focus sunlight with large mirrors. The gases produced by vapourizing the surface would act as a propellant to adjust the object's trajectory.
    4. Attach large solar sails. These are large reflective mirrors that "catch" charged particles from the Sun (solar wind) and act like giant sails in space.  

Continual vigilance and the development of some of these strategies will cost many tax dollars. As citizens, we have to assess the potential risk from impacts in the light of other pressing issues such as climate change, disease, and poverty. Remember, extraterrestrial impacts have **low** frequency but extremely **high** cost to society when they occur.

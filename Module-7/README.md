#Impacts from Space and Mass Extinction Events  

**Learning Goals:**  

**A. Understand the concept of a biosphere and Earth System Science and that the biosphere has evolved over time**  
A **mass extinction** is a crisis that affects life right across the planet from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains. It is helpful when trying to imagine such an event to consider all life on Earth as being part of the **biosphere**, a thin layer of life that exists on the surface of the planet and that interacts with the hydrosphere (oceans, lakes and rivers), the atmosphere, and the lithosphere (the Earth's crust).  

We notice that the biosphere has evolved through time in that the ocean creatures are different from the past compared to now but both demonstrate an active marine community and diverse biosphere.  

You can think of life and the biosphere as a play that has been running for millions of years in which the cast of actors has changed from time to time. The biosphere is composed of millions of individual species. As the components of the biosphere (individual species) evolve or go into extinction over time the biosphere evolves and changes.  

**B. Distinguish between the oldest and youngest portion of a geological section using the Principles of Superposition, Original Horizontality, and Cross-cutting Relationships**  
**The Principle of Superposition**. This is a fundamental principle of stratigraphy (the study of rock layers) that was devised by Nicholas Steno in 1669. Basically, Steno states that in a succession of layered rocks, the rock layer at the bottom of the pile will be the oldest and the layer at the top the youngest. Effectively, "What's on top is youngest". In the figure below, the rocks at the bottom of the photograph will be older than those at the top.  


**C. Describe the concept of faunal succession and the use of fossils in correlation and in the subdivision of Earth history**  
**Principle of Faunal Succession.** This was devised by William Smith in 1799 who recognized that strata (a series or layers of rocks in the ground) of like age can be recognized by the fossils they contain even if the outcrops of strata are separated by large distances geographically. This only works because **species have evolved through time**. Using the appearance and disappearance of fossils to subdivide geological time is the science of **biostratigraphy**. Each fossil species is said to have a **range** through geological time. In other words, it exists in the geological record from the point that it evolves to the point that it becomes extinct.  

**D. Recognize the qualities that make fossils useful in biostratigraphy**

**E. Identify important historical figures in the development of stratigraphy and biostratigraphy**  
  1. James Ussher (1581 - 1665) : calculated Earth to be 6000 years old through studying the bible.
  2. George Cuvier (1769 - 1832) : examined remains of mammoths in Europe and concluded they were **once living** species that had become extinct.

**F. Appreciate the scale of changes that can occur over geological time scales**  

**G. List some of the major subdivisions / ages of the geological time scale and appreciate the relative scale between the Phanerozoic and the Precambrian**  
Today we have a time scale that divides and subdivides Earth's 4.6 billion years into various time periods (see figure below). In the figure, the subdivisions of time are called (starting from the left-most column to the right on page 9) 
  1. Eons: Precambrian and Phanerozoic, 
  2. Eras: Archean, Proterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, and 
  3. Periods: from the oldest, Cambrian, to the most recent, the Neogene.

**I. List some of the major developments in the history of life on Earth**  
**￼￼￼￼J. Define the characteristics of a mass extinction**  
**K. List the "Big Five" mass extinction events and their order through time**

**N. Describe the character of extinctions at the K/Pg boundary**  
**O. Discuss the evidence used to support the K/Pg impact**  
**P. Describe the location and probable nature of the K/Pg impactor**  
**Q. Describe the initial and long-term effects of the impact and their environmental consequences**  
**R. Consider other potential causes of the K/Pg environmental collapse**

**U. Describe some of the features and processes of crater formation**  
**V. Provide examples of Canadian Impact Craters**  
**W. Describe the hypothesis proposed by Raup and Sepkoski**

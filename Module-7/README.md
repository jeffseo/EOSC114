#Impacts from Space and Mass Extinction Events  

**Learning Goals:**  

**A. Understand the concept of a biosphere and Earth System Science and that the biosphere has evolved over time**  
A **mass extinction** is a crisis that affects life right across the planet from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains. It is helpful when trying to imagine such an event to consider all life on Earth as being part of the **biosphere**, a thin layer of life that exists on the surface of the planet and that interacts with the hydrosphere (oceans, lakes and rivers), the atmosphere, and the lithosphere (the Earth's crust).  

We notice that the biosphere has evolved through time in that the ocean creatures are different from the past compared to now but both demonstrate an active marine community and diverse biosphere.  

You can think of life and the biosphere as a play that has been running for millions of years in which the cast of actors has changed from time to time. The biosphere is composed of millions of individual species. As the components of the biosphere (individual species) evolve or go into extinction over time the biosphere evolves and changes.  

**B. Distinguish between the oldest and youngest portion of a geological section using the Principles of Superposition, Original Horizontality, and Cross-cutting Relationships**  
**The Principle of Superposition**. This is a fundamental principle of stratigraphy (the study of rock layers) that was devised by Nicholas Steno in 1669. Basically, Steno states that in a succession of layered rocks, the rock layer at the bottom of the pile will be the oldest and the layer at the top the youngest. Effectively, "What's on top is youngest". In the figure below, the rocks at the bottom of the photograph will be older than those at the top.  


**C. Describe the concept of faunal succession and the use of fossils in correlation and in the subdivision of Earth history**  
**Principle of Faunal Succession.** This was devised by William Smith in 1799 who recognized that strata (a series or layers of rocks in the ground) of like age can be recognized by the fossils they contain even if the outcrops of strata are separated by large distances geographically. This only works because **species have evolved through time**. Using the appearance and disappearance of fossils to subdivide geological time is the science of **biostratigraphy**. Each fossil species is said to have a **range** through geological time. In other words, it exists in the geological record from the point that it evolves to the point that it becomes extinct.  

**D. Recognize the qualities that make fossils useful in biostratigraphy**

**E. Identify important historical figures in the development of stratigraphy and biostratigraphy**  
  1. James Ussher (1581 - 1665) : calculated Earth to be 6000 years old through studying the bible.
  2. George Cuvier (1769 - 1832) : examined remains of mammoths in Europe and concluded they were **once living** species that had become extinct.

**F. Appreciate the scale of changes that can occur over geological time scales**  

**G. List some of the major subdivisions / ages of the geological time scale and appreciate the relative scale between the Phanerozoic and the Precambrian**  
Today we have a time scale that divides and subdivides Earth's 4.6 billion years into various time periods (see figure below). In the figure, the subdivisions of time are called (starting from the left-most column to the right on **page 9**) 
  1. Eons: Precambrian and Phanerozoic, 
  2. Eras: Archean, Proterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, and 
  3. Periods: from the oldest, Cambrian, to the most recent, the Neogene.  
  
Note that the **Precambrian**, when compared to **Phanerozoic**, is far less subdivided even though it represents the majority of Earth's history. This is due to an **extraordinary proliferation of fossils** at the base of the Phanerozoic in a period called the Cambrian.  

It was here that most of the creatures with **hard parts** like shells, teeth, and internal skeletons evolved. Fossils with hard parts fossilize much more readily than soft-bodied creatures. So, in addition to an increasing biodiversity as new species evolved, many of the new "hard part creatures" would more readily form fossils. Consequently the Phanerozoic is more finely subdivided that the Precambrian.  

**H. Understand how extinction events are linked to the structure of the geological time scale**  
  1. **Eras** are broad subdivisions that are particularly significant. They represent a grouping of geological periods. These major groupings are not placed arbitrarily but represent times when there has been a major change in the Earth's **biosphere**.
  2. As mentioned above, the base of the Phanerozoic is defined by the emergence of creatures with hard parts. The base of the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic, however, are based on the **emergence of new species following a mass extinction** at the top of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic respectively.
  3. The base of all periods is defined on the emergence or **radiation** of new species.  

  
**I. List some of the major developments in the history of life on Earth**  
**￼￼￼￼J. Define the characteristics of a mass extinction**
For an event to be considered as a mass extinction, it must be according to the following:
  1. **At least 30%** of Earth's species must be lost
  2. It must be across a **broad range of ecologies**, not restricted to any one niche
  3. It must have a **short/sudden duration** (around 1 million years maximum)

Example: The extinction of 45% of all species over 500 000 years is considered a MASS EXTINCTION
**K. List the "Big Five" mass extinction events and their order through time**  
  1. Cretaceous / Paleogene (Tertiary) (K/Pg), 65 Ma 
  2. Late Triassic, 205 Ma
  3. Permo / Triassic, 251 Ma
  4. Late Devonian, 360-375 Ma
  5. Late Ordovician, 440-450 Ma

Which pair of extinction events "bracket" the time of the dinosaurs?  
*Permo-Triassic and Cretaceous-Paleogene* (from 251 Ma to 65 Ma as shown in the image on page 9)  
**L. Distinguish between broad extinction-producing phenomena**  
Causes of Mass extinctions:
  1. Biological causes - Organisms being brought together that once lived in isolation can cause mass extinctions. For
example, many of the New Zealand ground dwelling bird fauna were devastated when human hunters and then later European mammals (cats, rats, dogs) were introduced. The three main modes of a biologically induced extinction are:
    1. **Competition** between creatures occupying the same ecological niche
    2. (excessive) **Predation**: Predators do not have to do the whole job, just drive a population to a low enough level then "random extinction" can complete the extinction. The idea behind a random extinction is that, although the number of individuals in a species may grow and the species may spread over a wide area, nothing ensures the permanent survival of a species.
    3. **Pathogens**: disease being introduced to an area by incoming plants or animals
  2. **Earth-based causes** - Extinctions influenced by Earth-based tectonic processes may be caused by changes in
continental configuration or changes in atmospheric composition.
    1. **Changes in continental configuration**. Changes in the distribution of continents can have a profound effect. Two major effects of continental configuration are detailed below.
      1. **Changes in climate, ocean cyclicity, sea level**. Weather patterns and the movement of the oceans are directly linked to the distribution of continents.  
      eg. **The Late Ordovician Extinction.**  
Gondwana (a continent consisting of South America, Africa, Antarctica, India, and Australia; see figure below) moves towards the South Pole during the late Ordovician causing a severe ice age. As water was locked up in the form of glaciers at the Southern Pole, sea level fell. This may have had a severe effect on creatures that lived in the shallow water close to the continental margins. As the sea retreated off the continental shelf and into the ocean basins, shallow marine ecosystems would have been devastated.
      2. **The greater the landmass the lower the diversity**. At the moment we have a relatively high biodiversity. This is in part due to the number of continents that are in effect isolated from one another. In times when there is a high degree of continental fragmentation, evolution can proceed in isolation to produce many different species on different landmasses. If plate tectonics causes the formation of a large interconnected land mass there will be more competition between species and lower biodiversity.  
      eg. **The Permo / Triassic Extinction**  
At the end of the Permian, plate tectonics had brought all the continents together to form the super continent of Pangaea (see figure below).  
    2. **Changes in the atmosphere** In addition to the climatic effects due to continental configuration, volcanic activity can also have severe effects. Gases such as carbon dioxide can cause greenhouse warming and aerosols may cause climatic cooling. These can significantly affect the health of the biota.  
  3. **Extraterrestrial impacts** discussed later on
  4. **Combination of many factors** It is very unlikely that any one factor would be responsible for a global crisis in the biosphere. A combination of events and circumstances are generally recognized as being the cause of mass extinction events. This will be described more fully as we learn about the Permo-Triassic Extinction.

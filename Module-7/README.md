#Impacts from Space and Mass Extinction Events  

**Learning Goals:**  

**A. Understand the concept of a biosphere and Earth System Science and that the biosphere has evolved over time**  
**B. Distinguish between the oldest and youngest portion of a geological section using the Principles of Superposition, Original Horizontality, and Cross-cutting Relationships**  
**C. Describe the concept of faunal succession and the use of fossils in correlation and in the subdivision of Earth history**  
**D. Recognize the qualities that make fossils useful in biostratigraphy**  
**E. Identify important historical figures in the development of stratigraphy and biostratigraphy**  
**F. Appreciate the scale of changes that can occur over geological time scales**  
**G. List some of the major subdivisions / ages of the geological time scale and appreciate the relative scale between the Phanerozoic and the Precambrian**  
**H. Understand how extinction events are linked to the structure of the geological time scale**  
**I. List some of the major developments in the history of life on Earth**

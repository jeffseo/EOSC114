#Module: The Unstable Ground - Landslides
**LEARNING GOALS:**
  1. **Explain how the socioeconomic impact of landslides depends on the type and characteristics of the landslide hazard.**
  2. **Distinguish between the different modes of failure (falls, flows, slides, topples, and spreads) and how they are influenced by geology.**
  3. **Define the chief components of landslide risk.**
  4. **Compare and contrast landslide causes and how they differ from landslide triggers.**
  5. **Assess the balance between the strength of the slope and the destabilizing forces due to erosion, vegetation, precipitation, and anthropogenic activity that are acting on it (Factor of Safety).**
  6. **Describe how groundwater affects shear stress and shear strength, and how it contributes towards the increased likelihood of a landslide.**
  7. **Outline the different factors, both natural and human, that contributed to the Vaiont landslide disaster.**
  8. **Differentiate the mechanism by which liquefaction landslides develop in loose sands and sensitive clays.**
  9. **Explain why British Columbia has the highest frequency of landslides in Canada and what the future holds as the population expands into mountainous regions.**
  10. **List the different human activities that contribute to increased landslide hazards.**
  11. **Relate the type of landslide damage expected as a function of its velocity.**
  12. **Identify tell-tale signs of an unstable slope.**
  13. **Compare and contrast avoidance, prevention, and protection strategies for dealing with landslide hazards.**
  14. **List the mitigation techniques commonly used for avoidance, prevention and protection strategies.**

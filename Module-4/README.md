#Module: The Unstable Ground - Landslides
**LEARNING GOALS:**
  1. **Explain how the socioeconomic impact of landslides depends on the type and characteristics of the landslide hazard.**
    1. Throughout the world, valleys in mountainous regions have experienced accelerated economic development in response to general population growth and associated demands for increased mining, forestry, and agricultural activities.
    2. Economic growth has demanded expansion of transportation and communication facilities. The short history of extensive human development in many regions, however makes the evaluation of potential landslide hazards and appropriate countermeasures very difficult.
    3. Vulnerability to landslides is increased by: 
      1. increasing population density
      2. use of marginal land
      3. rapid land-use change
      4. global warming
    4. Globally, landslide fatalities are typically underestimated as many fatalities are associated with the landslide trigger (earthquakes, floods, etc.) and not the landslide. The world's most devastating landslide disasters typically involve numerous fatalities due to both **direct** and **indirect** consequences.
  2. **Distinguish between the different modes of failure (falls, flows, slides, topples, and spreads) and how they are influenced by geology.**
    1. **falls** - a sudden, vertical movement of material. Falls occur on steep slopes with loose rock that may periodically detach from a surface on which little or no shear/sliding takes place. The material then descends mainly through the air by falling, bouncing, or rolling. Falls are very fast moving events, usually involve rocks, and are often related to the geologic structure of the slope.
      1. Of all landslide types, gravity has the greatest influence on falls that require almost near-vertical cliff faces in order to occur.
      2. Mechanical weathering, which is the physical break-up of material by freeze-thaw cycles, salt crystal growth, root wedging and penetration, and absorption of water without chemical changes also play significant roles in creating situations where falls are likely to occur.
      3. Depending on the type of material, falls are classified into three types:
        1. BEDROCK -> Rock Fall
        2. DEBRIS (Unsorted Soil) -> Debris Fall
        3. EARTH (Sorted Soil) -> Earth Fall
    2. **flows** - occur when there is a relatively large volume of water present in a mixture of soil and debris. Rather than moving downslope as a coherent mass, the material flows downhill as a chaotic, viscous mixture. Flows are differentiated based upon their velocity and the type of sediment involved (see figures below on page 42).
      1. **Rock or soil creep** is a type of flow where soil and upper bedrock zones moves downslope extremely slow. Usually movement is measured in millimeters or centimeters per year. Creep creates the most long-term economic problems compared to any other landslide type because it usually goes undetected until the damage is already done.
      2. **Debris flow** is a rapid flow of fully saturated debris (organic matter, sand, gravel, boulders) in a steep channel. They form a distinctive debris fan at the mouth of the channel or gulley as the material spreads outs because it is no longer confined.   Debris flows are common in British Columbia coastal mountains because heavy rains fall on steep slopes covered by loose sediments. 99 between Horseshoe Bay and Britannia has a history of destructive debris flows.
      3. **Debris avalanche** is a rapid and shallow flow of partially to fully saturated debris on a steep slope that is not confined to an established channel.
        1. Debris avalanches and flows are common in mountainous areas with high rainfall. They are extremely dangerous and destructive because they can move at speeds greater than ~330 km/hr. How destructive a flow is depends on its density and flow velocity.
        2. The amount of water in the flow dictates its viscosity while the abundance of rock determines its flow density. **The greater the velocity and density of the flow, the greater the corresponding amount of destruction.** Flow velocity is primarily a function of slope steepness and water content. The greater the water content of a flow, the less viscous it is and the faster it will move. Furthermore, because debris flows are made up of suspended grains of various sizes, they are extremely dense (rocks are ~2.7 times denser than water) and can transport large boulders. The larger the boulders entrained in the flow, the more damage the flow will likely incur.
    3. **slides** - Slides involve large volumes of rock or soil material moving as an initially coherent mass on a sliding surface. These may occur as:
      1. **Rotational slides:** where blocks of soil or weak rock move along a curved rupture surface that forms due to the shear forces in the slope exceeding the shear strength of the soils/rocks. During failure, blocks of material rotate and tilt.
      2. **Translational slides:** where blocks of strong rock move upon a weak plane or pairs of intersecting weak planes in the rock (joints, faults, bedding, etc.).
    4. **topples** - Topples require the forward rotation of material (rocks) about a pivot point below the center of gravity of the unit or in the slope (see below on page 38).
      1. Topples require fractured material oriented perpendicular and parallel to the slope face, which allows the material to be broken up into coherent pieces that roll forward down a slope. [There is no such thing as a debris topple]
    5. **spreads** - **Lateral Spreads** occur where there is a slow to rapid extensional movement of rock or soil - usually related to the sudden liquefaction of a weak soil layer (such as quick clays) and often triggered by earthquakes or explosions. Such spreads can occur on relatively shallow slopes.
      1. In areas where loose soils are saturated with water, seismic shaking (i.e. from an earthquake) can cause water pressures to dramatically increase. This results in **liquefaction**, the sudden loss of strength in the soil transforming its behaviour into that of a liquid.
      2. **Sensitive clays** or "Quick clays" are young marine clays that are deposited with a House of Cards-like structure. During an earthquake, this cardhouse structure may collapse and liquefy.
      3. Canada's Quick Clays are known as **Leda clay** which the St. Lawrence River valleys are lined with. Upon disturbance (e.g. earthquake), Leda clay may undergo a significant loss of shear strength, liquefying and flowing as a viscous mud, rapidly devastating large areas of relatively flat terrain.
  3. **Define the chief components of landslide risk.**  
**Mass movement**, sometimes also referred to as **mass wasting**, refers to the downslope motion of soil and/or rock materials under the influence of **gravity**.  
**Landslide** is a general term for mass movements. These events occur when the gravitational force pulling the slope material down exceeds the slope material's internal resistance to shear or failure. Materials move downslope by sliding or shearing along a weak failure plane or a number of failure planes.
    1. **Gravity and Shear Stress** - Gravity is the main force responsible for landslides. Gravity pulls everything toward the center of the Earth. On a flat surface, the force of gravity acts downwards which causes any object on a flat surface to remain still. On a slope, gravity can be broken down into two components (shown on page 13):
      1. **Gp** - The component of gravity that acts perpendicular to the slope. This component helps to hold an object or slope materials in place on the slope. (AKA **normal stress**)
      2. **Gt** - the component of gravity that acts tangential to the slope surface or parallel to and down the slope. This component pulls an object or slope materials in the down-slope direction, causing a **shear stress**.
      3. When the slope is steeper, the shear stress or tangential component of gravity, **Gt**, increases and the perpendicular component of gravity, **Gp**, decreases.
    2. **Shear Strength** - As shear stress pulls slope material downslope, forces resisting this movement will be induced. These forces include **frictional resistance** and **cohesion** among the particles of the slope material and are grouped under the term **shear strength**. We define **shear strength** as the internal resistance of a body to shear stress or a material's internal shearing resistance. Therefore, by increasing friction and cohesion, shear strength increases and the factors that affect friction and cohension include:
      1. type of soil/rock
      2. condition of geologic materials (how eroded are they)
      3. presence of weak surfaces (joints and faults)
      4. pore water pressure within the slope
    3. **The Factor of Safety** - the ratio of the forces that resist movement to the forces that drive movement. We use the factor of safety to indicate slope stability. (Equation on page 14)
      1. When Fs >= 1.0, i.e., shear strength is greater than or equal to shear stress, the slope is stable.
      2. When Fs < 1.0, i.e., shear stress is greater than shear strength, slope failure is expected.
      3. Note from the equation above that slope failure can be achieved by either increasing shear stress OR decreasing shear strength. Thus, down-slope movement is favored by (1) steeper slope angles which increase the shear stress, and/or (2) anything that reduces the shear strength of materials, such as lowering the cohesion among the particles or lowering the frictional resistance. The converse is true for increasing slope stability.
    4. **Effective Stress** - the net sum of two opposing effects of normal stress and pores water pressure. Can be viewed as the sum of the contact forces between the grains divided by the total area.
      1.**Pore water pressure, u ** - factors that add spaces between grains (primarily water pressure), which decrease the strength of the material.
      2. The above equation (on page 16) for Factor of Safety states that high values of normal stress and cohesion and low values of pore water pressure and shear stress imply a more stable slope (FS > 1). Any change in the terms above will result in an increase or a decrease in the Factor of Safety, implying increased stability or increased instability of the slope.
  4. **Compare and contrast landslide causes and how they differ from landslide triggers.**
    1. A cause is a factor that makes slopes susceptible to movement without actually initiating a landslide. On the other hand, a trigger is the event that actually initiates movement by driving the Fs < 1.0. 
    2. Common triggers include: 
      1. earthquakes
      2. volcanic eruptions
      3. intense, short-period rainfall 
      4. mining and quarrying
      5. irrigation
      6. vegetation removal
      7. excavation of a slope at its toe loading of the slope at its crest 
      8. loud noises or vibrations
    3. Note that any of the above can either be a cause or a trigger. The only difference between them is that the trigger is the single event that starts the slope material in motion. Landslides may have several causes including geological, mechanical, hydrological, morphological, biological, physical, and anthropogenic (human) but can only have ONE trigger. In some cases, landslides may occur without an apparent trigger because of combined processes, such as progressive failure or weathering that gradually bring the slope to failure.
    4. Essentially, factors that decrease slope stability when the Fs >= 1.0 or when shear strength is greater than shear stress are considered causes.
  5. **Assess the balance between the strength of the slope and the destabilizing forces due to erosion, vegetation, precipitation, and anthropogenic activity that are acting on it (Factor of Safety).**
    1. **Erosion** is the transport of material away from its source. There are many different agents of erosion but water is the mos common. **Rapid erosion** occurs when large storms rapidly erode and undercut coastal slopes which can trigger large landslides. Ex. 1935 UBC washout. Removing material at the base of a slope can cause slope failure in one of two ways:
      1. The driving mass becomes greater than the resisting mass.
      2. The slope steepness at the base of the slope increases such that shear stress becomes greater than shear strength.
    2. **Vegetation** is  factor that influences slope stability by affecting the shear strength of the materials comprising the slope. 
      1. Plant roots increase soil cohesion and strength by helping to bind loose materials. In addition, roots decrease surface erosion and help to absorb excess water through evapotranspiration.  
      2. Removal of vegetation can make slopes unstable. Furthermore, landslides are more likely to occur on slopes that have been clear-cut or completely ravaged by fire, between about 4 to 15 years after logging or burning. This is because it takes time for the remaining root structures to degrade. However, once decay has occurred, soil cohesion decreases and shear failure surfaces can develop at the interface between the soil horizon and the underlying bedrock material.
    3. **Precipitation** - landslides occur more frequently after periods of heavy railfall as a result of water affecting the erosion rates, interacting with geologic materials, and its affect on pore pressure as discussed before. On the west coast of Canada, landslides are more common in the winter months when precipitation is high as well as in the spring when the winter snow pack begins to melt.
    4. **Anthropogenic Activity** - human causes of a landslide include:
      1. excavation of a slope at its toe
      2. loading of a slope at is crest
      3. Deforestation for construction and development, including clear-cut logging on slopes
      4. irrigation
      5. mining
      6. water leakage from utilities
      7. Artificial vibration
    5. **Additional factors**:
      1. **Water content** plays an important role in either causing or hindering mass wasting and landslides:
        1. excessive amount of water can increase a slopes mass which increases the **shear stress**
        2. water can affect fluid pressure which reduces friction and ultimately reduces **shear strength**
        3. water can increase the weathering of rocks and can wedge apart rocks
        4. in sediment, water helps or hinders cohesion. In sand, water can make it went and help build a verticle wall. If it's too wet, then if flows like a fluid and cannot remain in position as a wall.
      2. **Volcanic activity** - Deposition of loose volcanic ash on hillsides commonly is followed by accelerated erosion and frequent mud or debris flows triggered by intense rainfalls. Volcanic eruptions have directly triggered some of the largest historic landslides.
      3. **Earthquakes** - Strong ground shaking during seismic activity is a very common triggering mechanisms for landslides in many different topographic and geologic settings. Earthquakes as small as M 4.0 may trigger landslides in susceptible slopes, and larger earthquakes can generate thousands of landslides. **seismic loads destabilize slopes by inducing shear stresses thereby weakening the internal structure of the slope material.**

  6. **Describe how groundwater affects shear stress and shear strength, and how it contributes towards the increased likelihood of a landslide.**
    > 1. **Water content** plays an important role in either causing or hindering mass wasting and landslides:
        1. excessive amount of water can increase a slopes mass which increases the **shear stress**
        2. water can affect fluid pressure which reduces friction and ultimately reduces **shear strength**
        3. water can increase the weathering of rocks and can wedge apart rocks
        4. in sediment, water helps or hinders cohesion. In sand, water can make it went and help build a verticle wall. If it's too wet, then if flows like a fluid and cannot remain in position as a wall.
      
      Additionally, a relationship between the intensity and abundance of precipitation and landslide type has been observed. Heavy and prolonged rainfall can increase groundwater levels as a result of deep infiltration of abundant water. An elevated groundwater table tends to trigger more deep-seated and slower moving landslides such as slumps versus shallower, more fluid, and faster moving (and more dangerous) flows.
  7. **Outline the different factors, both natural and human, that contributed to the Vaiont landslide disaster.**
    1. Human factors that contributed to the Vaiot landslide include:
      1. Not enough thorough geological investigations of all section of slopes during construction
    2. Natural factors that contributed to the landslide include:
      1. Water content
  8. **Differentiate the mechanism by which liquefaction landslides develop in loose sands and sensitive clays.**
    1. In areas where loose soils are saturated with water, seismic shaking (i.e. from an earthquake) can cause water pressures to dramatically increase. This results in **liquefaction**, the sudden loss of strength in the soil transforming its behaviour into that of a liquid.
    2. **Sensitive clays** or "Quick clays" are young marine clays that are deposited with a House of Cards-like structure. During an earthquake, this cardhouse structure may collapse and liquefy.
    3. Canada's Quick Clays are known as **Leda clay** which the St. Lawrence River valleys are lined with. Upon disturbance (e.g. earthquake), Leda clay may undergo a significant loss of shear strength, liquefying and flowing as a viscous mud, rapidly devastating large areas of relatively flat terrain.
  9. **Explain why British Columbia has the highest frequency of landslides in Canada and what the future holds as the population expands into mountainous regions.**
    1. Reasons include:
      1. Western Canada's mountainous terrain leads to higher shear stress which drives down the Fs.
      2. complex geology (see schematic in Figure LA.49 on page 55), the abundance of unconsolidated glacial sediments sitting on top of bedrock, and high precipitation are factors in lowering shear strength.
      3. Frequent earthquakes increase the trigger frequency.
      4. Additonal info from previous questions: 
        1. British Columbia's Fraser River delta is underlain by deep water-saturated, loose, silty-sand deposits. This makes this area, especially the cities of Richmond and Delta, highly vulnerable to earthquakes and damage due to liquefaction and lateral spreads.
        2. Debris flows are common in British Columbia coastal mountains because heavy rains fall on steep slopes covered by loose sediments. Highway 99 between Horseshoe Bay and Britannia has a history of destructive debris flows.
  10. **List the different human activities that contribute to increased landslide hazards.**
    1. Recall, that by definition, natural disasters must include a human component. A 60 million-ton landslide that occurs in the middle of the Coast Mountains and does not affect humans is not considered a natural disaster. However, if the same-sized landslide were to occur along the North Shore it would be. Therefore, humans need to be also taken into account inadvertently when looking at landslides in a natural disasters context.
    2. People heighten landslide natural disasters by:
      1. Developing on steeper slopes - usually a response to overpopulation, overcrowding, and lack of space.
      2. Removing vegetation
      3. Excavation and slope loading
      4. Altering water drainage
      5. Altering climate - global warming
  11. **Relate the type of landslide damage expected as a function of its velocity.**
    1. The amount of water in the flow dictates its viscosity while the abundance of rock determines its flow density. The greater the velocity and density of the flow, the greater the corresponding amount of destruction. Flow velocity is primarily a function of slope steepness and water content. The greater the water content of a flow, the less viscous it is and the faster it will move. Furthermore, because debris flows are made up of suspended grains of various sizes, they are extremely dense (rocks are ~2.7 times denser than water) and can transport large boulders. The larger the boulders entrained in the flow, the more damage the flow will likely incur.
    2. Basically, faster it is, more damage it will do.
  12. **Identify tell-tale signs of an unstable slope.**
    Scar at the top, track running downhill, broken/bent trees(?)
  13. **Compare and contrast avoidance, prevention, and protection strategies for dealing with landslide hazards.**
    1. **Avoidance (avoid the problem)**: An often used method of avoiding the problem is relocating a facility, structure, or route of a planned new road or rail line, to avoid areas along which landslide hazards may be a problem.
    2. **Landslide prevention**: This approach works towards preventing a landslide from occurring. This is usually done by reducing the driving forces (e.g. active mass, pore pressure, etc.) or by increasing the resisting forces (e.g. anchors, buttresses, etc.) examples in Figure LA.44 of page 50
    3. **Landslide protection**: Landslide protection works towards minimizing the hazard presented, for example by rockfalls. As it would be difficult to prevent the numerous individual rock blocks that might endanger a road or structure from falling, the alternative is to allow them to fall while protecting structures by catching the rock blocks before they do any damage (e.g. using rock fall nets, etc.). Hazards can be minimized by controlling the distance and direction of travel of the falls.
  14. **List the mitigation techniques commonly used for avoidance, prevention and protection strategies.**
    1. avoidance: avoid the problem
    2. prevention:
      1. increase stability by reducing the mass of soil/rock within the slope or remove the unstable block all together
      2. increase resisting forces by applying a resisting mass at the toe of the slope. Can also use a wire cage (gabion) to hold the mass in place.
      3. use rock bolts and steel mesh nets to stabilize rock faces by anchoring the mass to the slope.
      4. drainage - drainage pipes can be used to allow water to flow out of a slope. When both surface/subsurface water are controlled, the effects of water are minimized. Water seepage forces driving a landslide are controlled and pore pressures that reduce the effective strength are lowered.
    3. protection:
      1. Barriers: let falls occur and control their distance and direction of travel. These systems are not infallible.
      2. Rockfall nets can be used for smaller rocks.

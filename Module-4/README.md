#Module: The Unstable Ground - Landslides
**LEARNING GOALS:**
  1. **Explain how the socioeconomic impact of landslides depends on the type and characteristics of the landslide hazard.**
    1. Throughout the world, valleys in mountainous regions have experienced accelerated economic development in response to general population growth and associated demands for increased mining, forestry, and agricultural activities.
    2. Economic growth has demanded expansion of transportation and communication facilities. The short history of extensive human development in many regions, however makes the evaluation of potential landslide hazards and appropriate countermeasures very difficult.
    3. Vulnerability to landslides is increased by: 
      1. increasing population density
      2. use of marginal land
      3. rapid land-use change
      4. global warming
    4. Globally, landslide fatalities are typically underestimated as many fatalities are associated with the landslide trigger (earthquakes, floods, etc.) and not the landslide. The world's most devastating landslide disasters typically involve numerous fatalities due to both **direct** and **indirect** consequences.
  2. **Distinguish between the different modes of failure (falls, flows, slides, topples, and spreads) and how they are influenced by geology.**
  3. **Define the chief components of landslide risk.**  
**Mass movement**, sometimes also referred to as **mass wasting**, refers to the downslope motion of soil and/or rock materials under the influence of **gravity**.  
**Landslide** is a general term for mass movements. These events occur when the gravitational force pulling the slope material down exceeds the slope material's internal resistance to shear or failure. Materials move downslope by sliding or shearing along a weak failure plane or a number of failure planes.
    1. **Gravity and Shear Stress** - Gravity is the main force responsible for landslides. Gravity pulls everything toward the center of the Earth. On a flat surface, the force of gravity acts downwards which causes any object on a flat surface to remain still. On a slope, gravity can be broken down into two components (shown on page 13):
      1. **Gp** - The component of gravity that acts perpendicular to the slope. This component helps to hold an object or slope materials in place on the slope. (AKA **normal stress**)
      2. **Gt** - the component of gravity that acts tangential to the slope surface or parallel to and down the slope. This component pulls an object or slope materials in the down-slope direction, causing a **shear stress**.
      3. When the slope is steeper, the shear stress or tangential component of gravity, **Gt**, increases and the perpendicular component of gravity, **Gp**, decreases.
    2. **Shear Strength** - As shear stress pulls slope material downslope, forces resisting this movement will be induced. These forces include **frictional resistance** and **cohesion** among the particles of the slope material and are grouped under the term **shear strength**. We define **shear strength** as the internal resistance of a body to shear stress or a material's internal shearing resistance. Therefore, by increasing friction and cohesion, shear strength increases and the factors that affect friction and cohension include:
      1. type of soil/rock
      2. condition of geologic materials (how eroded are they)
      3. presence of weak surfaces (joints and faults)
      4. pore water pressure within the slope
    3. **The Factor of Safety** - the ratio of the forces that resist movement to the forces that drive movement. We use the factor of safety to indicate slope stability. (Equation on page 14)
      1. When Fs >= 1.0, i.e., shear strength is greater than or equal to shear stress, the slope is stable.
      2. When Fs < 1.0, i.e., shear stress is greater than shear strength, slope failure is expected.
      3. Note from the equation above that slope failure can be achieved by either increasing shear stress OR decreasing shear strength. Thus, down-slope movement is favored by (1) steeper slope angles which increase the shear stress, and/or (2) anything that reduces the shear strength of materials, such as lowering the cohesion among the particles or lowering the frictional resistance. The converse is true for increasing slope stability.
    4. **Effective Stress** - the net sum of two opposing effects of normal stress and pores water pressure. Can be viewed as the sum of the contact forces between the grains divided by the total area.
      1.**Pore water pressure, u ** - factors that add spaces between grains (primarily water pressure), which decrease the strength of the material.
      2. The above equation (on page 16) for Factor of Safety states that high values of normal stress and cohesion and low values of pore water pressure and shear stress imply a more stable slope (FS > 1). Any change in the terms above will result in an increase or a decrease in the Factor of Safety, implying increased stability or increased instability of the slope.
  4. **Compare and contrast landslide causes and how they differ from landslide triggers.**
    1. A cause is a factor that makes slopes susceptible to movement without actually initiating a landslide. On the other hand, a trigger is the event that actually initiates movement by driving the Fs < 1.0. 
    2. Common triggers include: 
      1. earthquakes
      2. volcanic eruptions
      3. intense, short-period rainfall 
      4. mining and quarrying
      5. irrigation
      6. vegetation removal
      7. excavation of a slope at its toe loading of the slope at its crest 
      8. loud noises or vibrations
    3. Note that any of the above can either be a cause or a trigger. The only difference between them is that the trigger is the single event that starts the slope material in motion. Landslides may have several causes including geological, mechanical, hydrological, morphological, biological, physical, and anthropogenic (human) but can only have ONE trigger. In some cases, landslides may occur without an apparent trigger because of combined processes, such as progressive failure or weathering that gradually bring the slope to failure.
    4. Essentially, factors that decrease slope stability when the Fs >= 1.0 or when shear strength is greater than shear stress are considered causes.
  5. **Assess the balance between the strength of the slope and the destabilizing forces due to erosion, vegetation, precipitation, and anthropogenic activity that are acting on it (Factor of Safety).**
    1. **Erosion** is the transport of material away from its source. There are many different agents of erosion but water is the mos common. **Rapid erosion** occurs when large storms rapidly erode and undercut coastal slopes which can trigger large landslides. Ex. 1935 UBC washout. Removing material at the base of a slope can cause slope failure in one of two ways:
      1. The driving mass becomes greater than the resisting mass.
      2. The slope steepness at the base of the slope increases such that shear stress becomes greater than shear strength.
    2. **Vegetation** is  factor that influences slope stability by affecting the shear strength of the materials comprising the slope. 
      1. Plant roots increase soil cohesion and strength by helping to bind loose materials. In addition, roots decrease surface erosion and help to absorb excess water through evapotranspiration.  
      2. Removal of vegetation can make slopes unstable. Furthermore, landslides are more likely to occur on slopes that have been clear-cut or completely ravaged by fire, between about 4 to 15 years after logging or burning. This is because it takes time for the remaining root structures to degrade. However, once decay has occurred, soil cohesion decreases and shear failure surfaces can develop at the interface between the soil horizon and the underlying bedrock material.
    3. **Precipitation**
    4. **Anthropogenic Activity**
    5. **Additional factors**:
      1. **Water content** plays an important role in either causing or hindering mass wasting and landslides:
        1. excessive amount of water can increase a slopes mass which increases the **shear stress**
        2. water can affect fluid pressure which reduces friction and ultimately reduces **shear strength**
        3. water can increase the weathering of rocks and can wedge apart rocks
        4. in sediment, water helps or hinders cohesion. In sand, water can make it went and help build a verticle wall. If it's too wet, then if flows like a fluid and cannot remain in position as a wall.

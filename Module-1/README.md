#Module: Is the Earth A Fragile System?  
1. **Explain what density is and how it relates to stratification.**
  1. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. It describes how much mass fits into a space.
  2. less-dense materials float on top of denser materials which can lead to a **layering** of materials. Namely, the materials are **stratified** into layers.
  3. Over the long periods of geologic time, the materials that make up the earth have also become stratified. The most obvious is that the least dense (air) floats to the top, and the most dense (rocks) sinks to the bottom, leaving the middle- density materials (ocean) in the middle. But even within the atmosphere, the ocean, and the Earth, there is also stratification. The resulting layers are given names:
    1. **Atmosphere**:
      1. Exosphere (where hydrogen and helium escape to space)
      2. Thermosphere 
      3. Mesosphere 
      4. Stratosphere 
      5. Troposphere (the layer containing storms)
    2. **Ocean**:
      1. Surface zone / mixed layer 
      2. Intermediate layer(s)
      3. Deep / abyssal / bottom layer
    3. **Earth**:
      1. Lithosphere (solid, crust) 
      2. Asthenosphere (plastic rock) 
      3. Mesosphere (solid rock) 
      4. Outer core (liquid metal) 
      5. Inner core (solid metal)
2. **Explain why disaster scales are based on the Order-of-Magnitude concept and interpret graphs with logarithmic scales.**
  1. **Order of magnitude** (power of ten) is used in disaster scales to indicate intensity and interpret graphs with logarithmic scales since it is simpler to understand/analyze.
3. **Relate natural-disaster risk and intensity to frequency, return period, and consequences (costs).**
  1. More-intense disasters occur less frequently. Namely, intense disasters are relatively rare.
  2. **Return period**: average number of years between disaster events of the same magnitude.
  3. You must be very careful when you interpret and utilize return-period data. 
    1. First, they are average statistics of PAST weather, not certainties of what will happen in the FUTURE
    2. Second, although winds of 140 km/h happened once every 50 years on average, the actual time period between any two events could have been less or more than 50 years.
    3. Third, even though you might live for another 50 years in the Queen Charlottes, it is possible for you to experience a 160 km/h wind. Even if 160 km/h winds might have a return period of say 75 years, that does not prevent it from happening during the 50 years that you live there.
    4. Lastly, all the caveats above ignore the additional possibility that the climate might change between the past measurements and your future period of interest.
4. **Explain how recent disasters were associated with the concentration or dilution of energy.**
  1. **Energy** causes things to move or change. Many disasters release immense amounts of energy, thus causing catastrophic changes.
  2. Concentration of Energy:
    1. In Area: Many of the energy sources are **diffuse** (weak, but covering a wide area). To create natural disasters requires the concentration of this energy into a small area. **Example:** Diffuse solar radiation (spread over the surface of the Earth) causes sensible heating of the air and ocean, some of which converts into latent heat by evaporating seawater. This warm, humid air can be concentrated by wind circulations, and drawn into hurricanes where it is released as violent winds, rain, waves, and storm surges.
    2. In Time: Other energy sources are **gradual** (weak, but spanning a long time). To create natural disasters requires the energy to continually build-up, allowing sudden release in a short time. **Example:** Movements of tectonic plates (large pieces of the Earth's crust) are gradual (in mm/a), but they allow stresses to build to the point where strain causes fracture along the fault lines, allowing the sudden movement that is an earthquake.
  3. Original sources for the energy that drives disasters on Earth are:
    1. Impacts from space, KE
    2. Gravitational, PE
    3. Radioactive devay, nuclear energy
    4. Solar/radiative, nuclear energy
5. **Get the disaster info you need from reliable sources.**
6. **List the 1st and 2nd most common elements in the Earth, ocean, and atmosphere.**
  1. Earth:
    1. Earth's Core:
      1. iron, Fe
      2. Silicon, Si
    2. Earth's Crust:
      1. Oxygen, O
      2. Silicon, Si
  2. Ocean:
    1. Oxygen, O
    2. hydrogen, H
  3. Atmosphere:
    1. Nitrogen, N
    2. Oxyge, O
7. **Describe how viscosity and compressibility relate to the phase of matter.**
  1. **Viscosity**: is a measure of how much fluids resist flowing or changing their shape. The greater the viscosity, the more it resists change, and the more force must be applied to make it change. Namely, higher-viscosity fluids are thicker, gooier, or less runny.
  2. **Compressibility**: is the ability of a material to be squeezed or expanded, so that the mass fills less or more space.
  3. Phases of matter:
    1. Solids: Not very fluid (high viscosity) and not very compressible
    2. Liquids: Very fluid (medium/low viscosity) and not very compressible
  	3. Gases: Very fluid (low viscosity) and very compressible

8. **Be able to diagnose the type of strain by the way a material deforms.**
  1. **Strain**: the change in shape or size (i.e., the deformation) of a solid object. Types of strain are:
    1. Elastic: The ability of an object to change shape (i.e., deform) when forced, but to spring back to its original shape when the force is released. For example: rubber band, spring
    2. Plastic: The ability to permanently change shape or deform when forced. For example: ice in glaciers, soft metals, even some rocks
  2. Properties of materials based on their ability to strain:
    1. Ductile: Very plastic (bends and deforms easily). For example: gold
    2. Brittle: Not plastic; fractures (breaks) instead of bending. For example: ceramic dishes
9. **Explain why gravity affects motion and energy.**
10. **List the 5 types of energy, and describe what causes them to vary.**
  1. Work: Work, **W**, depends on the force, **F**, that pushes or pulls an object over the distance **d** the object moves. W = Fd.
  2. Potential Energy: The work needed to raise an object of mass **m** a distance **z** against the pull of gravity **g**. PE = gmz 
  3. Kinetic Energy: Energy possessed by moving objects. KE = (1/2)mv^2 where **m** is the mass, and **v** the velocity.
  4. Sensible Heat: The heat that we can feel (sense) in the form measurable by temperature
  5. Latent Heat: heat is stored (hidden) when matter changes phase from solid to liquid, or from liquid to vapour. For changes in the opposite direction, namely from liquid to solid, or from vapour to liquid, latent heat is released.
11. **Explain (with examples) how energy conservation applies to natural disasters.**
  1. Energy can **easily change in form** between work, heat, kinetic, and potential energies.
  2. **Energy is conserved** when it changes from form to form.
  3. All the natural disasters studied in this course involve motion and **KE**. Some examples of energy conversions associated with natural disasters are:
    1. Kinetic energy of an asteroid is converted into heat (sensible and latent) when it strikes Earth.
    2. Heat causes water to expand into steam in the Earth's crust, which does work when it moves magma, some of which rises (increasing PE) in volcanoes.
    3. Potential energy of rocks high on the slopes of a volcano is converted into kinetic energy when they fall down during a landslide or lahar.
12. **Describe relationships between force, pressure, stress, strain, energy, and power.**
  1. **Pressure P** is force per unit surface area, applied **perpendicular** to the surface. 
  2. **Stress Ï„** is force per unit surface area, applied **parallel** to the surface. Stress tends to **strain** objects.
  3. Units for preassure and stress: 1 N/m^2 = 1 Pascal (Pa)
13. **Describe population growth and explain why it is important for natural disasters.**
  1. **Population Growth**: undergoing **exponential growth** at the moment. 
14. **Explain how Earth's carrying capacity and overpopulation are related to the fate of the human race, and anticipate your role in it.**

#Module: Is the Earth A Fragile System?  
1. Explain what density is and how it relates to stratification.
2. Explain why disaster scales are based on the Order-of-Magnitude concept and interpret graphs with logarithmic scales.
3. Relate natural-disaster risk and intensity to frequency, return period, and consequences (costs).
4. Explain how recent disasters were associated with the concentration or dilution of energy.
5. Get the disaster info you need from reliable sources.
6. List the 1st and 2nd most common elements in the Earth, ocean, and atmosphere.
7. Describe how viscosity and compressibility relate to the phase of matter.
8. Be able to diagnose the type of strain by the way a material deforms.
9. Explain why gravity affects motion and energy.
10. List the 5 types of energy, and describe what causes them to vary.
11. Explain (with examples) how energy conservation applies to natural disasters.
12. Describe relationships between force, pressure, stress, strain, energy, and power.
13. Describe population growth and explain why it is important for natural disasters.
14. Explain how Earth's carrying capacity and overpopulation are related to the fate of the human race, and anticipate your role in it.

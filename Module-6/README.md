#Module: The Violent Ocean - Waves and Tsunami
**Learning Goals:**  

**A. Identify key properties of waves**  
Crest: highest point of a wave  
Trough: lowest point of a wave  
Wavelength, L or λ: distance between two successive crests or two successive troughs of a wave; (metres)  
Wave Height, H: vertical distance between crest and trough; (metres)  
Amplitude, a: H ÷ 2; (metres)  
Period, T: time for one wavelength to pass a point; (minutes or seconds)  
Frequency, f: number of waves passing a point per unit of time; (per minute or second)  
Celerity or Speed, S: distance traveled per unit time; (metre per second)  
Steepness: a measure of the "peakedness" of a wave; the ratio of Height to Wavelength, H / L; (no units)

**B. Use these properties to determine wave speed and behavior in either shallow or deep water**  

**Waves with great heights transport more energy** than waves with shorter heights. Usually, though not all the time, waves with great heights also have long wavelengths. Therefore, energy transported by waves is related to the wave height, H (only applies to deep water waves).  
**Frequency formula:** f = 1 / T and f = c / λ (where c = wave speed)  

**C. Explain how waves move matter and energy**  

**D. Describe the forces that generate waves, eliminate waves, and return the ocean to a flat, undisturbed surface**  
Generating/Disturbing Forces and the Wave types:
  1. Wind over ocean -> Wind wave
  2. Changes in atmospheric pressure; Storm surge; Tsunami -> Seiche
  3. Faulting of sea floor; Volcanic eruption; Landslide -> Tsunami
  4. Gravitational attraction; Rotation of Earth -> Tide  
**E. Explain the factors that determine the roughness of the sea**  

**F. Describe how waves interact; explain constructive and destructive interference**  

**G. Describe wave refraction, seiche (standing waves in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies), and resonance; how do these affect the coast and people?**  

**H. Relate wave interference and resonance to marine hazards**  

**I. Describe how tsunami form and how they are detected**  

**J. Explain how a tsunami compares with other ocean waves**  

**K. Discuss why tsunami come ashore so violently**  

**L. Identify tsunami warning signs, and know how to respond**  

**M. Describe the risks from a tsunami for the coast of British Columbia, especially one resulting from a megathrust earthquake.**  

**N. Describe how storm surges are generated**  

**O. Identify where and how the maximum surge occur in a hurricane**  

**P. Define wave breaking and determine when a wave will break**  

**Q. Explain differences between surging, plunging, and spilling breakers**  

**R. Predict the type of breaking wave that will be found on a given beach**  

**S. Describe how coastlines affect waves, and how waves affect coastlines**  

**T. Compare and contrast the effects of artificial barriers such as groins, seawalls, and other structures, on coastal processes**  

**U. Relate these changes to risks for coastal communities**

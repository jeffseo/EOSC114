#Module: The Violent Ocean - Waves and Tsunami
**Learning Goals:**  

**A. Identify key properties of waves**  
Crest: highest point of a wave  
Trough: lowest point of a wave  
Wavelength, L or λ: distance between two successive crests or two successive troughs of a wave; (metres)  
Wave Height, H: vertical distance between crest and trough; (metres)  
Amplitude, a: H ÷ 2; (metres)  
Period, T: time for one wavelength to pass a point; (minutes or seconds)  
Frequency, f: number of waves passing a point per unit of time; (per minute or second)  
Celerity or Speed, S: distance traveled per unit time; (metre per second)  
Steepness: a measure of the "peakedness" of a wave; the ratio of Height to Wavelength, H / L; (no units)

**B. Use these properties to determine wave speed and behavior in either shallow or deep water**  
  1. **Deep-water waves.** Deep-water waves are waves that are traveling in ocean depths d equal or deeper than L / 2 (see figure and table below). These waves do not "feel the bottom" because their wave bases are shallower than the ocean bottom. Particle orbital motion is circular.  
  2. **Shallow-water waves.** Shallow-water waves are waves that are traveling in shallow water relative to their wavelengths, that is, where the water depth d is equal or shallower than L / 20. These waves are said to "feel the bottom" as the water particles are dragging on the bottom as they move. Particle orbital motion is elliptical to flat.  

Basically, given depth d, check whether it is greater than or equal to L/2 for deep water wave and less than or equal to L/20 for shallow water wave. If neither, it is Transitional/Intermediate water wave that are circular to elliptical in Particle orbital motion.  
  
Deep-water waves are also called dispersive waves because the speed of travel is related to their wavelength (distance from crest to crest). In other words, waves with longer wavelengths travel faster than short waves.  
The speed of deep-water waves can be calculated as:  
  S = sqrt([g*L]/2pi), ￼where L is the wavelength and g is the gravitational constant = 9.8m/s^2.  
  S = 1.56 * T, where T is the period of the wave.  

A shallow-water wave is called non-dispersive because its wave speed is controlled only by the depth of the water. This means that all shallow-water waves, regardless of length, travel at the same speed when they are at the same depth. To calculate the speed of shallow-water waves, we use the following equation:  
  S = 3.1*sqrt(d), where d is the depth of the water; the calculated speed is in units of metres / seconds. When using this simplified equation, the unit for d must first be converted to metres.  
  

**Frequency formula:** f = 1 / T and f = c / λ (where c = wave speed)  

**C. Explain how waves move matter and energy**  
When wind blows across the ocean surface, energy is transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean. The wind pushes the surface "skin" of the ocean and a series of small wrinkles, the capillary waves, develops. As the wind speed increases, or as wind blows over longer periods of time and over the same area, more energy is transferred to the surface ocean and the waves grow larger.  

**Waves with great heights transport more energy** than waves with shorter heights. Usually, though not all the time, waves with great heights also have long wavelengths. Therefore, energy transported by waves is related to the wave height, H (only applies to deep water waves).  

**D. Describe the forces that generate waves, eliminate waves, and return the ocean to a flat, undisturbed surface**  
Generating/Disturbing Forces and the Wave types:
  1. Wind over ocean -> Wind wave (Most common)
  2. Changes in atmospheric pressure; Storm surge; Tsunami -> Seiche
  3. Faulting of sea floor; Volcanic eruption; Landslide -> Tsunami
  4. Gravitational attraction; Rotation of Earth -> Tide  

Restoring Forces and the wave types:
  1. Surface tension -> Capillary Wave
  2. Gravity -> Surface gravity waves (Wind wave, Seiche, Tsunami, Tide)  



**E. Explain the factors that determine the roughness of the sea**  
To reiterate, the condition of the surface ocean, or its sea state (roughness) depends on three factors:
  1. Wind strength/speed
  2. Fetch (Uniterrupted distance of the wind blowing in same direction)
  3. and Wind duration, the length of time that the wind has been blowing over the fetch  
  
When wind blows across the ocean surface, energy is transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean. The wind pushes the surface "skin" of the ocean and a series of small wrinkles, the capillary waves, develops. As the wind speed increases, or as wind blows over longer periods of time and over the same area, more energy is transferred to the surface ocean and the waves grow larger.  

There is a point though when the amount of energy put into the ocean by a specific wind reaches it's maximum. At this point, the sea state is said to be fully developed.  

as wind blows over the fetch (left to right in schematic, left panel), waves are transformed from capillary waves to **ripples** to **chop** (short waves). Once the excess energy input by the wind equals the energy dissipated from waves breaking, the sea is said to be **fully developed** (photo on top, right panel). Waves in this condition are chaotic, with waves of varying heights, lengths, speed, and direction. As waves are sorted out, they develop into **swells** (photo bottom, right panel) and propagate away from the fetch area in groups called **wave trains**. (Page 9)   

**F. Describe how waves interact; explain constructive and destructive interference**  

**G. Describe wave refraction, seiche (standing waves in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies), and resonance; how do these affect the coast and people?**

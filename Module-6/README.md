#Module: The Violent Ocean - Waves and Tsunami
**Learning Goals:**  
A. Identify key properties of waves  
B. Use these properties to determine wave speed and behavior in either shallow or deep water  
C. Explain how waves move matter and energy  
D. Describe the forces that generate waves, eliminate waves, and return the ocean to a flat, undisturbed surface  
E. Explain the factors that determine the roughness of the sea  
F. Describe how waves interact; explain constructive and destructive interference  
G. Describe wave refraction, seiche (standing waves in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies), and resonance; how do these affect the coast and people?  
H. Relate wave interference and resonance to marine hazards  
I. Describe how tsunami form and how they are detected  
J. Explain how a tsunami compares with other ocean waves  
K. Discuss why tsunami come ashore so violently  
L. Identify tsunami warning signs, and know how to respond  
M. Describe the risks from a tsunami for the coast of British Columbia, especially one resulting from a megathrust earthquake.  
N. Describe how storm surges are generated  
O. Identify where and how the maximum surge occur in a hurricane  
P. Define wave breaking and determine when a wave will break  
Q. Explain differences between surging, plunging, and spilling breakers  
R. Predict the type of breaking wave that will be found on a given beach  
S. Describe how coastlines affect waves, and how waves affect coastlines  
T. Compare and contrast the effects of artificial barriers such as groins, seawalls, and other structures, on coastal processes  
U. Relate these changes to risks for coastal communities

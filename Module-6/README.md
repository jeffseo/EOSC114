#Module: The Violent Ocean - Waves and Tsunami
**Learning Goals:**  

**A. Identify key properties of waves**  
Crest: highest point of a wave  
Trough: lowest point of a wave  
Wavelength, L or λ: distance between two successive crests or two successive troughs of a wave; (metres)  
Wave Height, H: vertical distance between crest and trough; (metres)  
Amplitude, a: H ÷ 2; (metres)  
Period, T: time for one wavelength to pass a point; (minutes or seconds)  
Frequency, f: number of waves passing a point per unit of time; (per minute or second)  
Celerity or Speed, S: distance traveled per unit time; (metre per second)  
Steepness: a measure of the "peakedness" of a wave; the ratio of Height to Wavelength, H / L; (no units)

**B. Use these properties to determine wave speed and behavior in either shallow or deep water**  
  1. **Deep-water waves.** Deep-water waves are waves that are traveling in ocean depths d equal or deeper than L / 2 (see figure and table below). These waves do not "feel the bottom" because their wave bases are shallower than the ocean bottom. Particle orbital motion is circular.  
  2. **Shallow-water waves.** Shallow-water waves are waves that are traveling in shallow water relative to their wavelengths, that is, where the water depth d is equal or shallower than L / 20. These waves are said to "feel the bottom" as the water particles are dragging on the bottom as they move. Particle orbital motion is elliptical to flat.  

Basically, given depth d, check whether it is greater than or equal to L/2 for deep water wave and less than or equal to L/20 for shallow water wave. If neither, it is Transitional/Intermediate water wave that are circular to elliptical in Particle orbital motion.  
  
Deep-water waves are also called dispersive waves because the speed of travel is related to their wavelength (distance from crest to crest). In other words, waves with longer wavelengths travel faster than short waves.  
The speed of deep-water waves can be calculated as:  
  S = sqrt([g*L]/2pi), ￼where L is the wavelength and g is the gravitational constant = 9.8m/s^2.  
  S = 1.56 * T, where T is the period of the wave.  

A shallow-water wave is called non-dispersive because its wave speed is controlled only by the depth of the water. This means that all shallow-water waves, regardless of length, travel at the same speed when they are at the same depth. To calculate the speed of shallow-water waves, we use the following equation:  
  S = 3.1*sqrt(d), where d is the depth of the water; the calculated speed is in units of metres / seconds. When using this simplified equation, the unit for d must first be converted to metres.  
  

**Frequency formula:** f = 1 / T and f = c / λ (where c = wave speed)  

**C. Explain how waves move matter and energy**  
When wind blows across the ocean surface, energy is transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean. The wind pushes the surface "skin" of the ocean and a series of small wrinkles, the capillary waves, develops. As the wind speed increases, or as wind blows over longer periods of time and over the same area, more energy is transferred to the surface ocean and the waves grow larger.  

**Waves with great heights transport more energy** than waves with shorter heights. Usually, though not all the time, waves with great heights also have long wavelengths. Therefore, energy transported by waves is related to the wave height, H (only applies to deep water waves).  

**D. Describe the forces that generate waves, eliminate waves, and return the ocean to a flat, undisturbed surface**  
Generating/Disturbing Forces and the Wave types:
  1. Wind over ocean -> Wind wave (Most common)
  2. Changes in atmospheric pressure; Storm surge; Tsunami -> Seiche
  3. Faulting of sea floor; Volcanic eruption; Landslide -> Tsunami
  4. Gravitational attraction; Rotation of Earth -> Tide  

Restoring Forces and the wave types:
  1. Surface tension -> Capillary Wave
  2. Gravity -> Surface gravity waves (Wind wave, Seiche, Tsunami, Tide)  



**E. Explain the factors that determine the roughness of the sea**  
To reiterate, the condition of the surface ocean, or its sea state (roughness) depends on three factors:
  1. Wind strength/speed
  2. Fetch (Uniterrupted distance of the wind blowing in same direction)
  3. and Wind duration, the length of time that the wind has been blowing over the fetch  
  
When wind blows across the ocean surface, energy is transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean. The wind pushes the surface "skin" of the ocean and a series of small wrinkles, the capillary waves, develops. As the wind speed increases, or as wind blows over longer periods of time and over the same area, more energy is transferred to the surface ocean and the waves grow larger.  

There is a point though when the amount of energy put into the ocean by a specific wind reaches it's maximum. At this point, the sea state is said to be fully developed.  

as wind blows over the fetch (left to right in schematic, left panel), waves are transformed from capillary waves to **ripples** to **chop** (short waves). Once the excess energy input by the wind equals the energy dissipated from waves breaking, the sea is said to be **fully developed** (photo on top, right panel). Waves in this condition are chaotic, with waves of varying heights, lengths, speed, and direction. As waves are sorted out, they develop into **swells** (photo bottom, right panel) and propagate away from the fetch area in groups called **wave trains**. (Page 9)   

**F. Describe how waves interact; explain constructive and destructive interference**  
Waves don't usually reflect (bounce back) when they strike other waves. Instead, they combine or are superpositioned, either constructively or destructively. **Constructive interference** occurs when the wave amplitudes (half the vertical distance between a trough a crest) reinforce each other, building a wave of even greater amplitude, i.e. bigger waves. **Destructive interference** occurs when the wave amplitudes oppose each other, resulting in waves of reduced amplitude, namely smaller waves.  

Rogue waves result from the constructive interference between two wave trains. Because of their unpredictable nature, no safety precautions can be taken to prevent unnecessary death and destruction.  

**G. Describe wave refraction, seiche (standing waves in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies), and resonance; how do these affect the coast and people?**  

**Wave Refraction**. Waves usually approach a shore at an angle, rarely head-on or at a perfect right angle (90°). Because waves slow down as the depth becomes shallower, the segment of the wave that is closest to shore will be "feeling the bottom" and slowing down before the rest of the wave that is farther out.
This results in the refraction or bending of the wave, allowing it to be nearly parallel to the shore as it approaches (see figure below).  

Every enclosed body of water has a natural resonance. A **seiche** (pronounced saysh) is a resonant wave in a body of water caused by a disturbance by wind or seismic activity. The water sloshes back and forth within the water body, with the wave racing between opposing shores. Seiches commonly form in lakes or landlocked seas but can also form in semi- enclosed seas. For example, the North Sea often experiences a lengthwise seiche.  

The effect of a seiche is similar to that of a storm surge. The added danger is that the seiche can oscillate back and forth across the body of water for some period of time.  

seiches were observed to be generated when a tsunami entered a semi- enclosed body. Hilo Bay in Hawaii, has been identified as a location that is critically vulnerable to damaging effects from a tsunami because the Bay has a resonance that is a factor of the tsunami period. Historically, the tsunami damage suffered by the residents of Hilo has been a combination of the effects of the tsunami and the tsunami-generated seiche.  

**H. Relate wave interference and resonance to marine hazards**  

**I. Describe how tsunami form and how they are detected**  
A tsunami (the Japanese term is used for both singular and plural) is a wave or series of waves generated by the rapid displacement of large amounts of ocean water.  

Large displacements of oceanic water can be caused by:
  1. Earthquakes (vertical thrusts from subduction zones)
  2. Volcanic eruptions
  3. Landslides into the ocean
  4. Icebergs falling from glaciers
  5. Meteor impacts

Submarine earthquakes are the most common cause of tsunami. Also considered as **seismic sea waves**. The "right" kind of earthquake is needed to generate a ￼tsunami, namely, one produced when a tectonic plate moves over or under ￼another. This type of plate movement occurs at normal or reverse faults and ￼results in the seafloor moving vertically.  

trans-Atlantic communications cable are laid across the sea floor to detect mass movement of mud and sand. When the cable breaks, we can determine the speed of submarine landslides based on the timing.  
**Pacific Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (PTWS)** based in the same headquarters as the PTWC in Hawaii. The PTWS currently has 25 member nations, mostly from the Pacific, and involves the use of **24 seismic stations, 53 tide stations, and 100 dissemination** points located in the Pacific Basin.  
Here is how the PTWS works:  
  1. an earthquake of sufficient size to trigger the alarms, set at the threshold of 6.5 on the Richter Scale, is detected  
  2. seismic data is collected, the earthquake is located, and its magnitude is computed  
  3. reports from tide stations are monitored for any indication that a tsunami has been generated, i.e., anomalous changes in wave height other than that from tides  
  4. if so, a warning is transmitted to the participating agencies (dissemination points) for relaying to the public  
  5. predetermined plans to evacuate people from endangered areas are implemented  

British Columbia is part of the **West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center** which is a Regional Warning System to warn the population where immediate response ins necessary.  

A fairly new monitoring system, developed by the **Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL)** based in Seattle, WA, has recently been added to the PTWS. The **DART® (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis)** is a real-time tsunami monitoring system consisting of "**tsunameters**" (monitoring devices) and buoys positioned at strategic locations throughout the world's ocean. The tsunameter is a seafloor bottom pressure recording (BPR) system capable of detecting tsunami as small as 1 cm (wave height in the middle of the ocean). The data generated by the bottom meters are transmitted to the moored surface buoy which then sends the data to various Warning Centers via real-time communications.  
￼   
**J. Explain how a tsunami compares with other ocean waves**  
Check page 48 of the Module PDF.  Tsunami are shallow water waves.
Similar to waves:  
  1. tsunami travel long distances across the ocean without losing energy  
  2. much of the death and damage can be minimized if an appropriate warning system is in place   
  3. local topographic features magnify the effects of tsunami, making Bays and Harbours especially vulnerable to extensive damage from large waves  

**K. Discuss why tsunami come ashore so violently**  
Due to Tsunami having ultra long wavelengths and period, a huge mass of water (a wall of water) comes onshore which can be devastating. Waves on the other hand come to shore with relatively short wavelengths and periods; this means that wave breakers arrive and recede quickly.  

**L. Identify tsunami warning signs, and know how to respond**  
Tsunami notifications will usually be broadcast in several ways: loud hailer, siren, phone fan-outs, etc. Everyone is advised to follow the directions of local emergency officials and stay tuned to local radio or TV stations for information and instructions from emergency officials in the area.  

**Tsunami Safety Rules**  
  1. A strong earthquake felt in a low-lying coastal area is a natural warning of possible, immediate danger. Keep calm and quickly move to higher ground away from the coast.
  2. When you hear that an earthquake has occurred in the ocean or coastline regions, prepare for a tsunami emergency.
Be aware that tsunami can occur at any time, day or night and that they can travel up rivers and streams that lead to the ocean.
  3. A tsunami is not a single wave, but a series of waves. Stay out of danger until an "ALL CLEAR" is issued by a competent authority.
  4. Approaching tsunami are sometimes heralded by noticeable rise or fall of coastal waters. This is nature's tsunami warning and should be heeded.
  5. Approaching large tsunami are usually accompanied by a loud roar that sounds like a train or aircraft. If a tsunami arrives at night when you cannot see the ocean, this is also nature's tsunami warning and should be heeded.
  6. A small tsunami at one beach can be a giant a few kilometres away. Do not let modest size of one make you lose respect for all.
  7. Sooner or later, tsunami visit every coastline in the Pacific. All tsunami - like hurricanes - are potentially dangerous even though they may not damage every coastline they strike.
  8. Never go down to the beach to watch for a tsunami!
  WHEN YOU CAN SEE THE WAVE, YOU ARE TOO CLOSE TO ESCAPE.
  9. Tsunami travel faster than a person can run!
  10. During a tsunami emergency, your local emergency management office, police, fire, and other emergency organizations will try to save your life. Give them your fullest cooperation.
  11. Homes and other buildings located in low-lying coastal areas are not safe. Do NOT stay in such buildings if there is a tsunami warning.
  12. The upper floors of high, multi-story, reinforced concrete hotels can provide refuge (vertical evacuation) if there is no time to quickly move inland or to higher ground.
  13. If you are on a boat or ship and there is time, move your vessel to deeper water (at least 2,000 metres). If there is concurrent severe weather, it may be safer to leave the boat at the pier and physically move to higher ground.
  14. Stay tuned to your local radio, marine radio, Weather Radio, or television stations during a tsunami emergency.     Bulletins issued through your local emergency management office and National Weather Service offices can save your life.

**M. Describe the risks from a tsunami for the coast of British Columbia, especially one resulting from a megathrust earthquake.**  
For British Columbia, where the threat of a megathrust type of earthquake is a reality, one of the greatest hazards after such a large earthquake is a tsunami. Residents at high-risk areas must be aware that a strong near-shore earthquake may generate a local tsunami. Therefore, it is highly recommended those in these areas (see map below) move inland or to high ground immediately as soon as they fseel strong ground shaking. Emergency officials may not have time to issue a warning.  

The funnel shape and configuration of the inlet were the reasons for the extensive flooding and damage that occurred in Port Alberni. The narrow inlet leading to Port Alberni focused the energy from the tsunami into a very narrow space, magnifying its effect.  
a) the shape and configuration of coastal water bodies greatly affect the behaviour of tsunami as it approaches land  
b) long, narrow channels magnify the force of tsunami, causing more massive destruction and effects farther inland  

**N. Describe how storm surges are generated**  
A **storm surge** is an abrust bulge of water driven ashore by a hurrican and is generated by 2 processese occuring at the same time:
  1. Hurrican winds pushing water into a large/tall mound called the **wind-driven surge**;
  2. Rising of ocean water underneath the eye of storm because of low air pressure at the ocean surface. The effect of air pressure is called a **pressure surge**.  
Note: the surge is technically NOT a wave (it only has a "crest"), it behaves like a shallow-water wave in that the bulge becomes higher as the water depth gets shallower.  

Unlike common oceanic waves, storm surges do not break into surf. The bulge rushes inland as a sudden, very high, wind-blown tide. Storm surges are most disastrous during **high tide** because the height (and mass of water) of the tide adds on to that of the surge. Storm surges generated by hurricanes only last 1-3 days. Severity of the storm surge depends on the storm generating it.

**O. Identify where and how the maximum surge occur in a hurricane**  
When the wind-driven surge is in the same direction (onshore) as the pressure surge, this causes the maximum surge to occur in a hurricane. Ofcourse, this is one side of the hurricane and therefore on the other side, the winds would be directed away from land (offshore) and thus the force of the storm surge on land is at a minimum.

**P. Define wave breaking and determine when a wave will break**  
**Breaking Waves**. We learned earlier that as a **swell** reaches the coast, its steepness increases to a point where **H / L** (the ratio of wave height to wavelength) nears the value of 1 / 7. At the same time, the ratio of the wave height to the depth of the water, **H / d** also approaches a value of 3 / 4. Beyond these critical points, the wave crests become unstable and the wave **breaks**. Whitecaps (froth) begin to form as the wave has turned to **surf**, the turbulent mass of agitated water rushing onshore.  

When the wave breaks, its energy is dissipated in the surf zone and transformed into kinetic energy, affecting both the water and land, including the ocean bottom and the shore.  

**Q. Explain differences between surging, plunging, and spilling breakers**  

The shape, size, and behaviour of the breaking wave is controlled by the slope of the ocean bottom (see accompanying figures on page 62):
  1. Areas where the ocean bottom is **flat** or **gentle** produce spilling breakers; spilling breakers release their energy over a wide area. These "waves" are good for (safe) surfing!
  2. Areas with **moderately steep** ocean bottoms produce **plunging** breakers. These waves are for expert surfers only!
  3. Areas where the ocean bottom is **very steep** produce **surging breakers**. These breakers release their energy in sudden bursts, making them potentially dangerous. Much of the wave energy is reflected back into water.  

**R. Predict the type of breaking wave that will be found on a given beach**  

**S. Describe how coastlines affect waves, and how waves affect coastlines**  

In the figure above, the evenly spaced long black arrows represent wave normals (or orthogonal lines, lines perpendicular to the wave crests) that outline how energy is transported and focused on headlands. As you can see from the figure, the waves are in fact refracting as they hit an irregular coast causing wave energy to focus on headlands, and disperse (spreads out) across bays. Thus over time the shoreline straightens out as waves erodes sediments from headlands and deposits these in bays.  

**T. Compare and contrast the effects of artificial barriers such as groins, seawalls, and other structures, on coastal processes** (starts on page 66)  
  1. **Groins**. One of the most popular ways for people to control beach erosion is to build groins, which are elongate structures that protrude perpendicular to the shoreline. These structures have been proven to be quite successful in trapping and retaining sediments on the up-drift side (that facing the wave front) (see figure below).
What is not realized is that groins interfere with longshore transport of sediments such that deposition and erosion occurs in unexpected places: deposition in the up-drift (upstream) side and erosion in the down-drift (downstream) side.
  2. **A jetty** is built to protect an inlet or harbour. Longshore drift naturally moves inlets over time -- one fills in, another opens. Jetties limit this, locking the inlet in place. Often built in pairs, one on each side of an inlet, they interfere with longshore drift in a manner similar to groins -- accretion on updrift side, erosion on downdrift side.
  3. **A breakwater** is another type of protective structure built to defend against wave action and erosion. These structures are built at a distance away from the coast being protected. As waves hit a breakwater, their energy is dissipated onto the structure. The area behind the breakwater becomes a safe harbour for boats and ships as they are protected from the pitching and rolling effects from waves.  
In addition, the coastline behind a breakwater is protected from the erosive action of waves. Because the waters are calm, deposition occurs and beaches build up behind the breakwater (see figure below). However, because the breakwater cuts off the energy required to drive the longshore transport, adjacent unprotected sections of the coastline do not receive fresh supplies of sediments and gradually shrink due to erosion.
  4. **A tethered-float breakwater** is an innovative variation of the standard breakwater. This system has the advantage over traditional structures of removing energy from waves without interfering with sediment transport along the shore. The system consists of 1.5-metre spheres of steel placed 1.5 m apart. The spheres are anchored to the ocean floor and held just beneath the ocean surface.
  5. **A seawall** is another form of coastal defense to reduce the effects of strong waves and to defend the coast around a town or harbour from erosion. In contrast to groins and breakwaters, which are built on the seaward side of the coastline, seawalls are constructed on the inland part of a coast. The walls are constructed to reflect wave power and can be sloping, vertical or curved.
Rather than protecting the beach, seawalls ultimately promote increased erosion and destruction of beaches. The figure below details the sequence of events that lead to beach loss.
**U. Relate these changes to risks for coastal communities**
